Message From Director
Dr. Tathagata Bandyopadhyay
As the alumni of DA-IICT mark two decades of significant contributions to society, we reflect on the visionary ideals of the late Shree Dhirubhai Ambani, an iconic industrialist, the nation's one of the greatest wealth creators, whose everlasting and deep impact resonates in Indian corporate history. Since its inception, our university has been dedicated to pioneering research and innovation in cutting-edge information and communication technology (ICT). Now, we are planning to broaden our scope of activities to other disciplines like law, management and health sciences to name a few leading to the evolution of DA-IICT into a multidisciplinary "Dhirubhai Ambani University (DAU)."
Our achievements have been recognized through various accolades and honours, including being named the Best University for Innovation in Gujarat in 2017 and receiving the Centre of Excellence Award from the Gujarat Government in 2022. We remain steadfast in our commitment to the founding vision of cultivating “a knowledge driven society rooted in intellectual competitiveness for global leadership.”
The remarkable professional accomplishments of our alumni post DA-IICT, I am confident, would inspire young talents to choose DA-IICT as their preferred destination for pursuing their dreams.
I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to meet each of you personally, to hear about your life experiences, and to share the present activities and future plan of our institute. Your visit would be greatly valued, and you are most welcome to return to your alma mater at any time you feel like. I look forward to the opportunity to reconnect and extend my best wishes to you all!
