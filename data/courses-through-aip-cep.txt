CEP
DAIICT has been very active in the area of the CEP. There are 50-plus faculty members with Ph.D. from reputed universities. Many of the faculty members collaborate actively with industries, and some faculty members also have industrial experience. DAIICT is focused on the areas of Information and Communication Technology. Since its inception, several CEPs have been conducted for the Indian Air Force, Indian Navy, SAC-ISRO, INS Valsura. Over the last five years, sponsored programs have been conducted for ICAR and ISRO on topics such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, Analytics in Agriculture, and so on.
The Continuing Education Program Centre (CEPC) at the Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT) is dedicated to enriching the skills and knowledge of a diverse audience. Our mission is to empower fresh graduates, undergraduates, faculty members from various institutions, industry professionals, government employees, and individuals seeking to upskill with the expertise of DA-IICT's faculty members. In collaboration with industry and other academic institutions, CEP offers a wide array of educational opportunities tailored to meet the specific needs of our participants.
AIP
DAIICT is also selected as an Anchor Institute by the Center for Entrepreneurship Development (CED), Department of Industries, Government of Gujarat, in the specialization area of Information and Communication Technology. This is a 5-year program. Under this program, nodal institutes are selected within Gujarat, and DAIICT faculty members train faculty members from these nodal institutes. The objective of this Anchor Institute Program is to achieve the ultimate goal of making students of Gujarat “industry ready” through well-trained faculty members of Gujarat-based engineering colleges. Over the last five years, AIP programs have been run on topics such as Operating Systems, Digital and Analog Communication Systems, Image Processing using VLSI Architectures, Multicore Processor Architecture and parallel Programming, Data Structures, Software Engineering, Programming, .Net and C#, Real-time and Embedded Systems, and others.
The core responsibilities and functions of the CEP & AIP include:
Program marketing/publicity, brochure creation (with content submission by Anchor faculty), feedback collection from participants, certificate preparation.
Coordinating and overseeing all academic outreach initiatives such as Conferences, Workshops, Symposia, Short-term courses, Training programs, and similar activities within the Institute.
Providing essential logistics and administrative support to ensure the smooth execution of these programs.
