Semester I-Foundation
Approaches to Culture & Communication | PC721 | 2-0-4-
4
This module will introduce students to a series of lectures and discussions on the role of technology and culture in communication. It aims to explore the ways in technology mediates and transforms cultural meanings in practices of social communication. The primary focus of this module would be on identifying specific fields of social communication, and understanding the kinds of design problems and solutions these can generate. It will introduce students to a range of analytical frameworks derived from studies of both aesthetics and semiotics. These frameworks would apply to understanding communication practices in Indian as well as in cross-cultural contexts. The module, which will be organized through readings, lectures, and seminar presentations aims to help students to intellectually integrate the domains of design and technology with society and culture. It will provide the essential foundations for them to undertake their individual projects in the third semester when they would be oriented to develop projects around either Visual Communication Design or Interaction Design.
Fundamentals of Design - I | PC722 | 3-0-4-
5
Design is an interdisciplinary activity – characterized by the constant preoccupation of co-relating disciplines, dealing with and trying to understand the complex and interesting worlds of the physical, biological, imaginary, and human all of which are multivariate in character. The Fundamentals of Design module is an attempt to sensitize students to this complex, dynamic and multidimensional scenario. The main objective of this module is to acquaint students of Communication Design to the means and methods of approaching, investigating and solving problems creatively by providing them with appropriate design and conceptual skill sets. The module would emphasize the latitude and value of individual thinking and the students’ ability to observe and see which would enable them to apply themselves creatively in solving problems. The areas that would be covered would be drawing – a process of observation, recording and representation which would include various kinds of representation for 2D. Objective of this module is in providing the student with a foundation in the grammar for design for communication based on ideas and concepts like color, composition, typography and layouts/space, illustration for specific needs. The module would culminate in a project that student would integrate skills and aptitude acquired in the module.
History of Design | PC748 | 2-0-2-
3
This module will introduce students to a brief history of modern Design practice and pedagogy as it evolved in the context of the Industrial Revolution and the onset of the age of mass production in the late 19th and early 20th century. The objective of this module is to enrich students’ understanding of Design not merely as practice but as a vast intellectual field spanning several disciplines. Students will be introduced to the economic, political, cultural and technological contexts and debates within which Design Schools, Design movements and Design Styles took shape in Britain, Europe, the United States and India. By the end of the module students are expected to develop a critical contextual understanding of the relations between technology, society and Design.
Fundamentals of Design - II | PC732 | 3-0-4-
5
This module deals with the advanced aspects of colour, composition, virtual 3D spaces, Typography as image, Illustration for information design, and Digital Photography as means of explore, visualize and communicate complex ideas with high levels of data density. This module would present an entry point to moving image and sound analysis, structure, methodology, concepts and experimentation for communicating specific ideas as well as to explore the possibilities/potential of each medium. Consideration of ‘mediums’ would focus on moving image scenarios that would include cinema, animation, multimedia and Sound Design and for 2D and virtual 3D environments. Students should acquire from the field of ‘Design History’ the understanding of visual language that is applied for range of visualization essential for practice of sketching, photography, film and animation.
Image, Text & Sound | PC749 | 3-0-4-
5
This module aims to introduce to elements of composition in Communication Design. It will encourage students to explore how words, images and sounds are put together for a range of communication events and forms. Students would be expected to observe, research, document and compose presentations deploying multi-media. They will be encouraged to read and explore ideas from design aesthetics and semiotics to understand compositional styles and aesthetic choices in traditional as well as contemporary forms of communication media in which visual, verbal and aural elements are combined to make effective communication events. Students would be able to appreciate diverse technologies of communication in rural or urban, India or in local or global media platforms and explore how image, text and sounds are combined to generate context-specific meanings in specific contexts. This could be exemplified in case of advertisements, mounting of event such as theatrical, exhibition, and installation or ritual performances. By the end of the semester students are expected to acquire the skills and the theoretical insights that are needed to understand the relationships between composition and context in multimedia formats.
Semester II-Extension of Foundation
Ethnography and its Applications | PC731 | 3-0-0-
3
Contemporary information technologies are often said to be immersive, creating distinctive and highly detailed virtual experiences. Thus, the discipline of ethnography, which teaches researchers to understand social activity through immersive exposure is particularly appropriate to the study of communication design Ethnographic analysis provides powerful tools to understand how communication systems deeply affect individuals and societies. The module introduces the foundations and basic methods of ethnography derived from the fields of visual anthropology and cognitive anthropology. It will look at several applications of these disciplines to current communication practices. Students would be expected to undertake fieldwork assignments and related applied activities such as collection of empirical data, qualitative data, contextual inquiry and usability testing that provides the foundations for user-centred interaction and visual design. The objective of the module is to provide the student the intellectual tools to develop research capacity for the final design projects they would have to undertake.
Information Design | PC746 | 1-0-4-
3
Information design covers the promoting and enhancing of making the complex simple. It facilitates and transforms complex, unorganized, or unstructured data into useful, usable information both with efficiency and effectiveness. The attempt would be to discover and articulate the meaning in data, and create the map that allows others to use the information easily, through meaningful reductions and interpretations of complex data by using writing and analytical skills to transform unstructured ideas into concrete, meaningful information. The module would cover the defining, planning, and shaping of the contents of a message. Particular focus will be on designing solutions based on the understanding of a specific environment and with the intention of achieving specific objectives with reference to the needs of users and creating navigation and hierarchy that makes information intuitively and easily accessible. The module encourages exploring how information can be structured and visualized to create effective communications and to stimulate viewer attention and engagement through design. Building sensitivity, via case studies, Information Collection, Conceptual Data Analysis, Information Mapping and Visualization along with User Studies are introduced as means towards developing concise, clear and visually sophisticated communication material. The module provides students with an introduction to structuring and presenting information with an emphasis on meaning, clear communication and visual aesthetics that in turn enhance how people read, understand and use information.
Principles of Interaction Design | PC752 | 1-0-4-
3
This module on Interaction design will introduce students to design problems and practices from the fields of human factors; human computer interaction, collaborative work and learning, digital design, cognitive ergonomics, informatics, information systems, and interface design. The module will cover the underlying principles of a wide range of issues, and include empirical studies with design problems based on both lab and field based exercises. The module is designed to cover the breadth of the field and to enable the students to be adept and competent in grasping and dealing effectively with design issues involving interaction with a range of devices, services and users. This module requires students to investigate a specific area or a context in depth and develop understandings and design implications in order to deliver an innovative proposal and prototype.
Introduction to Photography | PC725 | 1-0-4-
3
This module on Photography will build on previously learnt skill sets of students to help them frame an image using the camera – through observation, content, context, composition, colour, and light. Students will learn to train their eyes to develop compositions through the viewfinder and learn to effectively capture expressive moments with accuracy and aesthetics to develop the skills and sensibilities of storytelling through still images. The module aims to generate an understanding of the symbiotic relationship between the photographic image and other design skills and develop an understanding of digital practice, which includes the technical aspects of image –making such resolution, colour, contrast and light and the manipulation of these in accordance with the needs of specific Communication Design solutions.
Multi-Modal Storytelling | PC724 | 2-0-2-
3
This module will introduce students to the crucial role of storytelling in communication practices. The module will explore how narratives are interwoven into various media, encompassing verbal and written language, gestures, music, visual art, interactive medias and time-based audio-visual format. In the contemporary digital landscape, narratives have evolved into new and complex forms and applications. A multimodal narrative is a form of storytelling that seamlessly integrates multiple modes of communication, such as text, images, audio, and video, to create a richer and more immersive experience as well as sensitising the students to the requirements of different formats of storytelling. This approach harnesses the strengths of various media to enhance emotional and cognitive engagement, capturing the audience's attention and leaving a lasting impression. By integrating diverse formats, we can express ideas in a multitude of ways, catering to varied storytelling styles and making information both memorable and accessible. Contemporary digital media space offers enormous opportunities for many innovative narrative formats such as the "micro-narrative” or serialized story -telling where the user is allowed to engage with the content in bite-sized pieces. All this requires a deft and agile understanding of user-needs and the craft of multi-modal story-telling. By the end of this module, students will cultivate a deep understanding of both the thematic and modal aspects of storytelling. In other words, they will explore the structure of narratives and the art of their telling across different media, within diverse social and cultural contexts.
Fundamentals of Filmmaking | PC751 | 2-0-4-
4
The aim of the module is to introduce students to the elements of documentary filmmaking through a practical approach; to establish an understanding of the complexities of this medium through critical analysis and study of acclaimed documentaries and documentary filmmakers. With this as a base, students will be introduced to the basic narrative tools/devices used to tell a story – interviews, montages, inserts, intercuts, colour family, mood boards, voice over and sound the aim is to critically examine how each tool and device makes an impact on the overall narrative. By the end of the module students are meant to understand how narrative structures differ and how essentially these are driven by the imperative of what is to be communicated and to whom. In other words, how important it is to understand audiences in the shaping of films and how geography, history, culture, language affect the reception of a film. Finally, the module would also sensitize students to understand the relationship between the subject and a filmmaker and questions of ethics and integrity that inform filmmaking.
Semester III-Joining Concepts and Applications
Immersive Web Design | PC733 | 3-0-4-
5
This module introduces students to the principles and practices of immersive web design, emphasizing the integration of interactivity, multimedia, and user experience (UX) design. Through project-based learning, students will explore advanced web design concepts, including interactive interfaces, dynamic content, and immersive multimedia experiences. Students will be introduced to tools used in the web design process and encouraged to explore them. They will also become familiar with the overall process of creating and maintaining a website, including content creation, hosting, SEO, and development workflows. The course fosters a hands-on understanding of how web technologies and design principles converge to create compelling digital narratives. By the end of the module, students will have built a comprehensive web project demonstrating advanced immersive design capabilities, blending technology and creativity to craft impactful digital experiences. The module emphasizes the iterative design process, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and innovative use of web technologies for storytelling and interactive media production.
Animation & Motion Graphics | PC741 | 3-0-4-
5
This module aims to introduce students to the fundamentals of animation and motion graphics. It will cover the principles and dynamics of motion, exploring how to apply these concepts to both character-based animation and abstract motion graphics. The module would equip students with the basic concepts, methods/means and language to conceptualize and visualize simple character based ideas through animated sequences and short films as well as abstract narrative through shapes, forms, graphic imagery as part of motion graphics. Storytelling, Storyboarding, animatic, setting a stage, and kinetics would be the main areas to explore the limits of the medium. The module will also delve into ways to communicate complex ideas and hidden worlds effectively using the language of movement by animating objects and characters. Motion graphics, as a subset of digital animation combines graphic design elements, composition with movement. Deviating from traditional animation, motion graphics not just concentrates on character-driven storytelling, but into more abstract conceptual visual storytelling. The module will focus on principles of animation – characterization, lip synchronization, animation workflow, importance of sound along with graphic design fundamentals, abstract narrative to visualise data, statistics or ideas, integrating appropriate text and icons. Students will be introduced to key software’s like Adobe After Effects, Cinema 4D, and Blender and at the end of the course be conversant with conceptualising, designing and executing short animations films, title sequences and introduction, User Interface animations and data visualisation through movement over time.
Open Elective | PC743 | 2-0-2-
3
Faculty involved with the M.Des. programme and or visiting faculty would conduct a seminar or a workshop for the students to either learn or explore some new areas of multimedia techniques and applications. If and when required an open elective offered in the Institute may be considered as a substitute for the seminar module. In case a seminar or workshop is not offered the student could take up a reading and research (RR) module with any faculty member after providing the formal plan of arrangement between the student and the faculty concerned to the M.Des. committee. Please note that the focus of this module has been not fixed in order to take advantage of students’ changing interests, faculty’s own research interest and the particular area of expertise that a visiting faculty brings from outside including the design industry.
Research Project Seminar | PC740 | 2-0-4-
4
This seminar’s main focus will be help students to formulate their final project proposals. Students will be expected to engage in informed discussions about their design problems with the faculty. They will be required to provide a clear rationale for the selection of a project and explain how they intend to implement the skills and aptitudes gained from the modules offered in the program. It is essential that students in this seminar are intellectually capable of integrating the technical component of their design project with questions derived from their understanding of the social and cultural contexts of communication. They are expected apply the research methodologies learnt in the previous module and write up a concrete proposal in accordance with a set of given guidelines. The primary objective of this seminar is to enable students to make informed decisions about the nature of the project they wish to undertake and the range of intellectual skills they need to work on it. Once they have decided on a proposal, they will in the next and final semester work in consultation with an assigned team of faculty. This module will equip student with the necessary tools to determine appropriate methodology for specific design research needs and teach them how to find supporting resources, and the ability to critically evaluate existing research. This module should help the student to initiate and plan the individual research project in the IV semester.
Research Application: Constructing Narratives | PC745 | 2-0-4-
4
This module is meant to encourage students to apply the theoretical insights drawn from the earlier module on narratives and develop their own narrative form around a particular idea or message they wish to communicate. They will encourage translating narratives from one medium to another and analyzing the differing demands of each. This module will involve a group project wherein students will be tested on their capacities to work together and develop a product that reflects coordinated team work. For example, they can work together to develop a public interest message through paper, voice and screen and develop a keen sense of the narrative as it takes shape through each medium.
Semester IV
Final Thesis Project | PC714 | 6-0-24-
18
The last and final semester is dedicated to developing and completing the research proposal developed in the previous semester (See Semester III). This semester will give a chance for each individual to now undertake and execute the final project for which they have been provided both general foundations as well as specialized training in the various modules offered in the three semesters. Each student would be required to work in close individual collaboration with either one or two faculty members (at least one of them must be a regular faculty of the institute) to complete the final design project. The faculty would evaluate the work done and accordingly submit it for final processing by a jury of examiners.
It is expected that the individual student will work independently under the guidance from the research committee. Consultation with the committee members is essential to avoid poor quality work- leading to failure in the last module; in final analysis, nobody but the student alone is responsible for his/her project.
The last module will culminate into the seminar presentation where the students committee has to be present.
This seminar MUST be scheduled and held before the last week of the term.
It will be student’s responsibility to organize the final seminar date.
Each student will have to organize individual presentation for the study committee and be engaged in a discussion after the individual presentation is made.
This session would be open to the whole institution and subject to evaluation.
The committee members will evaluate the final product and it’s presentation and asks for the two copies of CD as well as a document on the project itself. Committee members may invite individuals or individual specially to assist in the evaluation of the student work from within the institute or out- side of the institute.
Document must be made available to committee members prior to the seminar.
If the final assessment requires that student makes some alterations to the final project, the committee would set up the dead line by which the revisions must be made by the student.
This would be required for the student to earn the final degree.
Teaching Methodology
In this specialization, each course is not a stand-alone learning experience but it is expected that in the course of study the connections, both vertically and horizontally are made by the student that culminates in their project in the final semester.
The teaching approach for each course comprises a combination of lectures, seminars, studio, and practical sessions. The lectures would mainly focus on basic ideas and concepts, which would be substantiated and discussed through seminars, engaging students in active participation in project work. Lecture sequences in a course may be conducted by multiple faculties, and the seminars would be designed to provide a bridge between the lectures and the studio and practical sessions. Emphasis would be that students learn how to learn, what is needed, and when it is needed; in an environment of ever-changing needs and technologies. For each course, the emphasis would be on research and project work that utilizes the methods and ideas learned from other courses.
Courses in the third semester (second year) are focused more on individual work rather than classroom sessions in order to apply the theory and practice in preparation for the final student project. The final student project worth 15 credits must be completed in the fourth semester.
