Provision of MOOC courses as electives
A student may be allowed to take relevant MOOC courses that can qualify as electives, subject to prior consent of a faculty mentor assigned by Dean-Academics. Maximum two such courses may be allowed to a student throughout the program and only one such course in a semester will be allowed.
Rural Internship
A unique feature of the program is the mandatory rural internship, which is expected to give the student a feel of his/her social milieu and is typically carried out with an NGO and Govt. organizations. The duration of the rural internship is 4 weeks and is carried out in the Winter break after the third semester. This course is graded as Pass/Fail.
Research/Industrial Internship
The student is required to do a 6-8 weeks industrial/research internship, which is offered in the summer break after the 6th semester. The student has a choice of taking an industrial internship or a research internship depending on his/her career goals.
Research internship is designed to train the students to carry out research and to expose them to research environment. The student learns how to carry out independent research and how to write a research report. This internship can be done on-campus or externally at other R&D organizations and universities.
Industrial internship is designed to train the students to the working environment in industry. Through this training the student learns about corporate culture. The internship enables the students to learn about the team work, to build inter-personal dynamics and behaviour, and to gain experience in real life problems. This course is graded as Pass/Fail.
BTech Project (BTP)
The BTP work can be a continuation of the work done during previous internships. In the BTech project (BTP) the student undertakes a problem of interest, identifies the issues involved, and develops techniques to address the issues. The student can undertake a theoretical study and/or experimental or developmental work. The work can be carried out individually or in groups under the supervision of faculty.
A student has option to do an Industrial Internship in the 8th semester in the off-campus mode. Industrial internship is to be done at an approved industry site with a designated industry mentor and a well specified project. This option is suitable for those students who want to gain an early industry experience to better prepare them as an industry professional. The Placement office will provide assistance in identifying industry for off-campus internships. The BTP and Internship are graded with letter grades on a 10-point scale.
Co-curricular Activities and Exploration Project
Co-curricular activities are non-class activities like sports, cultural and technical club activities. These courses run over the first four semesters and are graded Pass/Fail.
Exploration projects allow students to explore their surroundings to identify interesting problems that admit a design based and/or hardware based solution. Students are expected to work in groups of 8 to 10 under a faculty mentor over two semesters - second and third semester. This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis.
Credit Structure
The BTech program is designed to operate on a semester-based credit system with a 10-point scale. Each course is associated with a fixed number of credits. Credits are awarded on an L-T-P-C system (C=L+T+P/2) per semester, that is, the number of contact hours for Lectures (L), Tutorials (T) and Practical (P) in a week. Nominally, since a semester has around 14 weeks of classes, therefore, a 3-credit lecture course would amount to approximately 40 lecture hours in a semester.

HM216 Science, Technology, Society (3-0-0-3)
Course Objective:
This course is designed to encourage students to understand, explore and critically analyze ways in which science and technology work in diverse social contexts. It draws its basic approaches from Science and Technology studies (STS) which is a growing field of interdisciplinary studies that seeks to understand how science and technology shape human lives and livelihoods and how society and culture, in turn, shape the development of science and technology. This course, intends to introduce students to some of the key philosophical, sociological and historical approaches towards understanding the workings of science and technology in our times. By the end of the course, it is expected that students will have the conceptual tools and vocabulary to think about the meanings of science and technology in varied social, political and cultural contexts. They will be able to generate critical discussion around the impact of STS on their received ideas about science, and reflect upon their own professional goals and practice going forward.
Course Contents:
The course will be organized around four units, consisting of class lectures, discussion, and presentations. The first unit will map the broad field of STS. Students will be introduced to some of the historical and sociological approaches to the understanding of science and technology. They will be introduced to the ideas and works of some of the key thinkers and writers in this field and the nature of contemporary debate on the subjects raised by them. In these lectures we will explore basic questions about what modern science is, the relationship between science and technology, and the role of historical, sociological and anthropological studies of science and technology in helping us think about these questions.
Following this broad introduction to STS in Unit One, in Units Two and Three, students will be introduced to debates on science and technology in the Indian context. Class lectures and reading in Unit Two will focus on the structural impacts of colonialism, developmental planning and liberalization on the growth and development of Indian scientific and technological endeavors in different domains, especially public health.  Unit Three will focus specifically on the lives and questions raised by women in the fields of science and technology in post liberalization India. Together, these units will allow us to analyze the contemporary moment, and explore frameworks that seek to make sense of it. In Unit Four, students will be encouraged to take up the theoretical questions raised in Units One to Three, and pursue a short research study as a Group Project. The focus this year will be on the gendered worlds of science and technology, where we will look into the different ways in which social relations shape these fields and their questions.
