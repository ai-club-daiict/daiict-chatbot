Courses
Master of Technology in Information and Communication Technology – MTech (ICT) is a fulltime two-year (four semesters) program. The program has been specially designed to meet the increasing needs of professionals who would be able to respond to the convergence between computers and communication systems. The program aims to provide exposure to students who wish to build a professional career in ICT, working at the intersection of technology, research, and development in the areas of Machine Learning and applications to speech, image and vision, natural language processing and others, Data Analytics, Cyber Security, Distributed Computing, Software Engineering, Embedded Systems, VLSI Subsystem Design, FPGA, Low-power VLSI Design and Nano electronics, advanced wireless communication systems (including 5G and next generation wireless systems), advanced signal processing technologies and the confluence of these two.
The Program curriculum includes multiple specializations tracks that provide a strong foundation and advanced courses in each track. This program tries to leverage the strength and diversity of our faculty and currently offers the following specialization tracks:
Machine Learning
Software Systems
VLSI and Embedded Systems
Wireless Communication and Signal Processing
The M.Tech. program provides students with a rigorous understanding of both fundamentals and advanced knowledge in desired areas of specialisation. The graduates of the program would be well-positioned to work in the fast-growing ICT industry or to pursue a doctoral degree.
Students of the M.Tech. program are required to complete a set of program core courses, general elective courses, specialization core courses and specialization elective courses. The program structure is designed to allow a wide choice of electives in desired areas of specialisation. Apart from the courses, the students must complete two projects, a minor project in Semester 2 and Major project I spread over the summer semester and semester 3. The project components provide the students an opportunity to undertake directed research work under the supervision of a faculty mentor. In semester 4, a student can opt for Major project II, in continuation with Major project 1, or pursue an internship in the industry. Students interested in a thesis must enrol for Major project II in semester 4.
Each student joining the program will be assigned a faculty advisor who will provide general academic guidance and support to the student.
