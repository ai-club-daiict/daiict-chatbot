RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT @ DA-IICT
DA-IICT has emphasized and encouraged research right from its founding in the year 2001. Research-oriented M.Tech. and Ph.D. programs were started in 2002, and potential for quality research has always been an important criterion in faculty selection. A fundamental principle followed at DA-IICT from day one is that teaching and research must remain equally vital and important elements in the shaping of an academic institution.
At present active research is being carried out within the institute into various aspects of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and also into the many ways in which ICT impacts society and culture. Some of the current areas of faculty research are outlined
here
. Further details about specific research activities can be accessed by following the links provided.
An important aim of the research activity at DA-IICT is to enhance the quality of interaction between the institute and industry for solving technical problems in the broad field of ICT. Equally important is the aim of stimulating and enhancing the research ability and potential of DA-IICT students who have the interest and aptitude to carry out innovative research.
Research and related activities at the institute constitute three broad categories:
Sponsored research
activity requires the handing over of agreed-upon deliverables to the sponsoring agency or company. These deliverables may include technical reports, hardware and/or software design, documentation, et cetera.
Consultancy
work by faculty members is also encouraged. Based on the specific technical expertise of a faculty member, an external agency engages his/her services for a specified period of time, or for specific assignment.
For each of these two categories of work, the institute has developed guidelines which faculty members are expected to follow.
Basic research
carried out by faculty members is based primarily on their own interest and initiative. This type of research usually results in research publications in international journals and/or conferences.
The institute is provided with well-equipped laboratories, specialized equipment, the full range of required infrastructure, including campus-wide networking and high-speed internet access, subscription to hundreds of print and online journals, and more. Attractive stipends and scholarships are available for the right candidates as incentives for post-graduate research.
For DA-IICT students who wish to venture out with their own technology-based start-ups, from September 2007 the institute has started its own
Centre for Entrepreneurship and Incubation at DA-IICT (CEID).
Based on certain basic qualifying criteria, nascent technology ventures of students will be provided with crucial infrastructure support, mentoring and guidance for a period of up to two years.
