Title:
5G and 6G: Features and Research Opportunities
Abstract:
5G is a transformational technology. This seminar summarizes key features of 5G Release 15 including the New Radio (NR) air interface, NG-RAN, and 5G Core. Major features of Release 16 and 17 such as Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB), sidelink communications, NR-Unlicensed, NR Positioning, and Non- Terrestrial Network (NTN) are introduced. Vision of 6G is also provided. The seminar gives examples of research areas during the discussions of various 5G and 6G features.

Title:
Multi-armed Bandits for Wireless Networks: Introduction, State-of-the-art Works and Potential Research Directions
Abstract:
Multi-armed bandits (MAB) are popular online machine learning algorithms widely used for real-time decision-making without the need for prior training. They have been widely used for online advertisement selection to increase the number of clicks, clinical trials to identify best drugs, news personalization, decision making in financial markets and resource selection in wireless networks, internet of things (IoT) and robotics. In this talk, we will focus on introduction to MAB algorithms and their applications in wireless networks. We will also discuss current state-of-the-art works from algorithms as well as architecture perspectives followed by potential research directions.
Bio:
Dr. Sumit J Darak received UG degree from Pune University, Pune, India, in 2007, and the Ph.D. degree from Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, in 2013. He is currently an Associate Professor with the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-Delhi), Delhi, India. His research team is the recipient of the “DST Inspire Faculty Award”, "Best Thesis Award" in COMSNETs 2022, “Design Contest Winner'' VLSID 2022, “Best Paper Award” AIMLSystems 2021, “Second Best Poster Award” at COMSNETS 2019, “Second Best Paper Award” at DASC 2017, “Best Demo Award” at CROWNCOM 2016, “Young Scientist Paper Award” at URSI 2014 and 2017, and “Best Paper Award” at NCSIPA 2009.

Title:
Exploring Light Based Communication for Next Generation Vehicular, Indoor and Underwater Networks
Abstract:
Light based communication systems is a new communication paradigm which has been proposed recently to meet the capacity and safety requirements for next generation communication networks. In this talk, I will discuss the application of this paradigm in vehicular, indoor as well as underwater wireless scenarios. Specifically I will deliberate the pros and cons of applying light based communication architecture for V2X communication vis-à-vis conventional RF based DSRC framework. I will also share some of the preliminary analytical, simulation and measurement results obtained by our research group in this direction.
Bio:
