Biography
Dr. Srimanta Mandal received his Ph.D. from IIT Mandi, India, in 2017. He has been a postdoctoral fellow with the Department of Electrical Engineering, IIT Madras, India, from 2017 to 2018. Since October 2018, he has been with DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, where he is currently an associate professor. During his PhD, he received a travel grant from IIT Mandi for presenting work at the International Conference on Image Processing 2014, Paris, France. So far, he supervised 20 master’s students in their dissertation/project work and co-supervised 1 PhD student. He has published several articles in national/international journals and conferences. He received the best paper award (runner-up) at the Indian Conference on Computer Vision, Graphics and Image Processing 2018. He served as a reviewer for various conferences and journals. He is a senior member of IEEE and served as an executive committee member of the IEEE SPS Gujarat chapter from 2019 to 2022. He served as an Advisory Group Member, Department of Technical Education, Gujarat. He is a life member of IUPRAI and ISRS. His research interests include image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.
