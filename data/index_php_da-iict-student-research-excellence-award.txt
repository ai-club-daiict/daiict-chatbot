Eligibility Criteria
Selection Criteria and Process
List of Awardees
Objective:
To recognize and celebrate the achievement of the student-led original research that has resulted in publication at a reputed journal or a leading conference.
Award:
Award comprises a certificate and plaque/medal. The award is presented by the Director annually (the day before the convocation ceremony each year) to the students who have published in top quality journals/conferences.
Eligibility Criteria:
All currently-enrolled DA-IICT students (UG and PG) and the graduated students who received their degrees in the previous academic year
1
are eligible; specifically,
The UG students (the BTech ICT, BTech ICT with CS, the BTech in Math and Computing (MnC) or BTech EVD programs) up to one year after the completion of the program (e.g. for the annual award in January of 2025, the students of 2019-2023 batch, 2020-2024 batch, 2021-2025 batch, 2022-2026 batch, 2023-2027 batch and 2024-2028 batch are eligible).
The PG students (any of the Master's Degree (MTech, MSc, MDes) or the PhD degree) up to one year after the completion of the program or award of the degree in case of PhD students. (e.g. for the annual award in January of 2025, the Masters students of 2021-2023 batch, 2022-2024 batch, 2023-2025 batch and 2024-2026 batch are eligible).
The student will receive an award for each Q1 journal article (Q1 category journal, i.e., top 25 percentile category) and each conference (A*, A or B category) article that he or she has published
provided
the primary affiliation of the student in the published article is DA-IICT.
--------------------------------------
1
This provision allows the students to apply for this award even if their paper submission is still not accepted for publication at the time of their graduation, provided it is published within one year after their graduation.
.
Selection Criteria and Process (for the convocation to be held in January 2025):
The students will provide the information about all their eligible research publications
with a publication date (as per DOI) between January 2024 to December 2024
in a Google Form circulated by Dean Research. The form must be submitted by the deadline mentioned in the email from Dean Research’s office.
The data collected in the Google Form is provided to the Resource Center for verification, specifically regarding the
eligibility criteria
(i) the student is
an author with DA-IICT affiliation,
(ii) the publication venue belongs to the Q1 category of journals, and the A*, A or B categories for conferences, and (iii) the date is in the year 2024.
For the award eligibility, a journal paper has to be published at a journal with
Scimago Journal ranking
of Q1, and a conference paper has to be published at conferences with
core.edu
or
Aminer
rank of A*, A or B.
All the students who meet the aforementioned
Eligibility Criteria
will be selected for the
DA-IICT Student Research Excellence Award
.
The applicants will be informed about the date and venue of the award ceremony via email at least two weeks before the day of presentations (by the office of Dean-Research).
The list of selected candidates will be shared with the Registrar's office and award ceremony arrangements will be planned accordingly. In case a student can not attend the ceremony due to any unforeseen circumstances, he/she can contact the Registrar office and collect the award at a later date.
