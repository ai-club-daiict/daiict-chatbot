B.Tech. Information and Communication Technology (ICT)
Information & Communication Technology (ICT) embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. ICT is considered to be a discipline dealing with accessing, storage, processing, transmission, reception and display of information, primarily using digital systems and techniques. The curriculum in the B.Tech. (ICT) program tries to address the optimized convergence of existing Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) as well as Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) disciplines by identifying the broad areas of performance capabilities. It is also expected that B.Tech. (ICT) graduates would enjoy a special niche only if they have certain performance capabilities not found in conventional CSE and/or ECE graduates.

B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Computational Science
Computational Science is concerned with constructing mathematical models, simulating and quantitative analysis techniques, and using computers to analyze and solve scientific problems with applications in engineering and social sciences. In Computational Science, unlike the traditional theoretical and experimental approaches, scientists and engineers gain understanding mainly through the analysis of mathematical models implemented on computers. Typically, these models require massive amounts of calculations and are often executed on high performance computing backbone consisting of supercomputers or distributed computing or several inter-connected clusters of workstations and personal computers. The curriculum in
B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Computational Science
aims to provide expertise to the students in techniques involved in modelling and simulation of complex and large scale systems, implementation on computers through parallel and high performance computing techniques and finally analysis and visualization of these large scale data sets. Further details of the program are available
here
.
To complete the
B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Computational Science
Program successfully, the students have to take additional 18-24 credits worth of courses besides the usual ICT courses. The student must obtain a minimum CPI of 6.5 after completion of third Semester to continue in the program failing which she/he will be moved to the B.Tech. (ICT) Program. The students who have obtained a CPI of 7.5 and above may apply at the end of the third Semester for transfer to the B.Tech. (Computational Science) Program and the transfer will be granted only subject to availability of seats and in descending order from the highest CPI obtained.

.
B. Tech. Mathematics and Computing (MnC)
Mathematics and Computing (MnC) is a fusion of Mathematics and Computer Science that has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline over the past few years. It arises out of dealing with Mathematics as a fundamental tool in computing and with Computing as a primary component of mathematical problem solving. The program has been specially designed to meet the increasing needs of professionals who would be able to respond to the convergence between mathematical and computational problem solving.
The program aims at expanding the mathematical, algorithmic and computational thinking of students and at providing sufficient and solid foundation for skill development in MnC. A strong mathematical foundation would enable the study and analysis of abstract concepts and to model many real life problems mathematically, algorithmic thinking would provide ways to solve these mathematical problems in an automated way and computational thinking would allow for evaluating the efficiency of these solutions. The program aims to provide exposure to the students who wish to build a professional career in MnC, working at the cutting edge of technology, research and development. On successful completion of the program, the students would have acquired essential theoretical, technical and practical knowledge for solving real-world problems, and will have the ability to demonstrate excellent analytical, logical and problem solving skills. The students would have also acquired social and ethical attributes that would enable them in applying their skills for societal needs with effective communication both orally and in writing.

B. Tech. Electronics and VLSI Design (EVD)
Semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of the current revolution in electronics and computing. The Indian government has recently launched India Semiconductor Mission with a vision to enable India's emergence as a global hub in electronics manufacturing and design. Given the increasing interest of the nation in semiconductor manufacturing and R&D, the sector is likely to witness a spike in demand for engineers with semiconductor know-how. The objective of the B.Tech. in Electronics and VLSI Design (EVD) is to create industry ready undergraduate manpower for the semiconductor industry.
The focus of the Electronics and VLSI Design program is to impart state-of-the-art knowledge of advancing semiconductor and VLSI design along with development of embedded processors and high-performance computing systems those are used in modern electronic products. The graduates of this program will be able to design hardware and software, conceptualize, implement circuits and systems, build computing systems along with realization of next generation portable consumer electronics like mobile phones, tabs, bio-medical devices, modern communication systems and gaming devices The students will get exposure and hands-on training on various industry standard electronic design automation (EDA) tools such as Cadence, Synopsys, OrCad, MATLAB, Xilinx etc. and hardware boards viz. FPGA, CPLD, etc. to design integrated circuits. Students will also gain direct industry experience through internships. The rural internship during their course will enable students to appreciate the socio-cultural aspect of the Indian society and motivate to explore electronic based solutions to some prevailing needs of the rural India. The program also includes compulsory summer research internships to be taken up at research organization labs. Electronics and VLSI Design is an interdisciplinary program, allowing students to take various courses ranging from Circuits and Systems, Solid State Devices, VLSI Technology, Embedded Processors, Sensors and Systems, Real Time Operating Systems, IoT, Secure Devices, MEMS along with opportunity to take various discipline and free electives. Currently, there are two pathways offered to the students where he / she can take elective courses leading to specialization in:
Electronic System Design
VLSI Design
