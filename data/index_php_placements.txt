Placement at Dhirubhai Ambani University (Formerly DA-IICT): A Structured and Transparent Ecosystem
Placement activities at Dhirubhai Ambani University (DAU) are built on a foundation of structure, transparency, and integrity. The University follows a well-defined placement policy, a transparent slotting process, and enforces a strict zero-tolerance policy regarding student conduct and discipline during placement drives.
DAU is distinguished by its unique Placement and Internship Affairs Action Committee (PIAAC)—a dedicated body operating alongside the regular Disciplinary Action Committee (DAC). PIAAC plays a crucial role in ensuring that the placement ecosystem remains fair, ethical, and student-centric, while also supporting employers in smooth engagement.
Our students undergo rigorous and continuous preparation, including:
Training in
pre-placement tests, group discussions, debates, and interviews
Strong emphasis on
programming, data structures, algorithms, and foundational mathematics
Development of
oral and written communication skills
