"A vibrant campus life awaits you as a student of DA-IICT once you become a campus resident. Classes, lab sessions research projects, and exams are perfectly balanced with musical performances, sports, theatre, and spending time with friends at cafeteria hangouts. Our students ensure life happens 24*7 on campus. In the process, they become pros in choosing their priorities and managing their time effectively.
DA-IICT is uniquely positioned to give you the best of ICT education infused with a multi-disciplinary way of learning. Along with innovative courses, a wide choice of electives, a cutting-edge curriculum, and research opportunities, it offers an excellent learning and research experience. The learning extends beyond the classroom with a plethora of club activities that are geared towards professional as well as personal development. Additionally, students benefit from our faculty members who are both teachers as well as mentors to the students.
At DA-IICT, we believe in the overall holistic development of the students. As the Dean -Students, my role is to encourage and nurture the holistic development of our students through a portfolio of well-planned extra-curricular activities driven through 9 committees and 25 student clubs. I am also delighted to share that our students continue to make us proud every year by winning several state-level and national-level inter- collegiate and industry-driven competitions.
We are one of the first institutes to introduce rural internship which is a mandatory requirement of the B.Tech curriculum. The objective of this program is two-fold- to give students an understanding of the socio-economic realities of rural lives and sensitize them to the challenges and above all, to create a belief in the significance of inclusive growth which they can contribute to in the future.
Besides all this, DA-IICT offers you an opportunity to build friendships across barriers like language, region, religion, and caste and create bonds, memories, and experiences for a lifetime. I invite you to join us and become part of the rewarding experience at DA-IICT.
As the Dean -Students, I am always reachable to my students and parents, whenever required."

Microsoft Student Club
We are individuals who come together and share common interest putting our ideas into existence in order to contribute to the Microsoft Community. Many people have genuine ideas related to app and web development but there is no proper platform provided to them. We, as MSTC, come here and help them give the right environment to inculcate their ideas and develop for Microsoft. We aim to do this in as exciting and simplified manner as possible. If you want to find answers to your questions, share ideas, solve problems, or whatever may be your goal, MSTC is here to help you get more out of your ideas and technology. If you need help browse our club, or post a question and our community members and volunteers can help you understand the problem with advice or step by-step instructions. We will also come up with various events and competitions which would help you to create a strong foundation for your dream competitions like those of Imagine Cup. So basically, we are here to make you experience the windows development environment and encourage you to develop and contribute
