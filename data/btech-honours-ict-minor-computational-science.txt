Program Structure
DA-IICT launched the unique four-year undergraduate program leading to the degree of B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Computational Science from 2013-14 academic session.
The ICT embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. It is also expected that ICT graduates would enjoy a special niche only if they have certain performance capabilities not found in conventional CSE and/or ECE graduates. Logically this convergence takes place at the systems level, but at the same time it is necessary to accept a certain level of granularity as one goes down to the level of circuits, devices and materials. All programs are designed to operate on a semester-based framework that follows choice-based credit system.
Computational science involves use of mathematical models, numerical methods, quantitative analysis techniques, advanced computing capabilities and IT knowledge to understand and solve complex science, engineering and social problems aimed in improving products, processes, and work-flows. The institute started this program in the area of Computational Science to impart the necessary knowledge and insight to the students to build computational models to understand, analyze and address fundamental problems in the areas of societal importance.
The minor in CS program is focused on two main lines – theoretical learning and practical implementation. The students must take core/group-elective courses in the areas of Mathematics, Physics, Numerical and Computational Methods, Modeling and Simulation, High Performance Computing, Parallel Programming, Data analysis and Visualization. The electives are further designed to sharpen this skill-set by providing domain knowledge in interdisciplinary areas ranging from engineering to biological applications.
The B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Computational Science requires a student to complete additional 18 credits (four courses) in the core and elective components of Computational Science in addition to the B.Tech. in ICT program requirement.

Program Outcomes (POs) & Course Outcomes (COs) of The Program
Syllabus of The Program
Program Structure
The course structure of the curriculum is broadly classified into four categories.
Foundation or Core Courses:
Set of compulsory courses taken by every student for first five semesters. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, as well as courses in Humanities, Mathematics and Basic Sciences.
Elective Courses:
These courses add to both, the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the program. The students can choose the elective courses from the available ones from fifth semester onwards. The elective courses are grouped into the following categories.
ICT Electives
Technical Electives
Humanities and Social Sciences Electives
Science Electives
Open Electives
Internships and BTech Projects :
Students will do a rural internship during the third semester winter break at NGO or Government Organization. The students will do an industrial or research internship during the summer break in the end of their 6th semester. Finally the student will take a semester long on-campus project (BTP) or the off-campus project – Industrial Training Project (ITP).
Co-curricular Activities and Exploration Project:
Co-curricular activities are non-class activities like sports, cultural and technical club activities. These courses run over the first four semesters and are graded Pass/Fail.
Exploration projects allow students to explore their surroundings to identify interesting problems that admit a design based and/or hardware based solution and make such a product by leveraging the introduction to ICT skills learnt in the first semester. Students are expected to work in groups of 8 to 10 under a faculty mentor over two semesters - second and third semester. This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis.
A unique feature of the program is the mandatory rural internship, which is expected to give the student a feel of his/her social milieu and is typically carried out with an NGO and Govt. organizations. The rural internship is offered in the Winter break after the 3rd semester. After the completion of foundation courses, the student is required to take a 6-8 week mandatory industrial/research internship, which is offered in the summer break after the 6th semester. The student has a choice of taking an industrial internship or a research internship depending on his/her career goals. The student is required to take at least a semester long BTech project (BTP), during which he/she is required to demonstrate his/her ability to learn current areas of research and/or industrial interest. Furthermore, a student has option to do BTP as on-campus or off-campus mode, where the on-campus mode allows the student to explore his/her research interest under the supervision of a faculty, whereas the off-campus mode allows the student in getting exposure to industry and/or other R&D organizations/universities.
Most of the foundation courses are offered in the first four semesters and a part of the fifth semester. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, as well as courses in Humanities, Mathematics and Basic Sciences. In the remaining 3 and a half semesters, students take elective courses and do internships and projects.
The curriculum accommodates 166 credits, out of which 147 credits for courses and 19 credits for internships and project work. In addition, there are 6 credits for Co-curricular Activities courses and Exploratory Projects. Out of the 147 required coursework credits, 108 credits are allocated to compulsory courses (Foundation courses) and 39 credits are allocated to four kinds of electives (12 credits are allocated to ICT electives, 12 credits to Technical electives, 6 credits to Science electives, 3 credits to HASS elective and 6 credits to Open electives), which the student can choose according to his/her inclination and interest.
Semester-wise course sequence
Each course is associated with a fixed number of credits. Credits are awarded on an L-T-P-C system (C=L+T+P/2) per semester, that is, the number of contact hours for Lectures (L), Tutorials (T) and Practical (P) in a week. Nominally, since a semester has around 13–14 weeks of classes, therefore, a 3
credit lecture course would amount to approximately 40 lecture hours in a semester.

Environmental Science
The course is mandated by the UGC - under the direction of the Honorable Supreme Court - for all undergraduate degree programs offered by any University/College in India. The main objectives are (i) to sensitize the students to the Earth's environment, which sustains life on the Earth, and (ii) to bring awareness regarding climate change, sustainable development, and problems related to the environment affecting human society. The course's central theme is that the environment is both the supplier and the sink for humankind. Everything we humans use in our daily lives originates ultimately from the environment. Similarly, the waste we generate is also sent back to the environment. The course focuses on the sustainable use of the environment.

Modeling and Simulation
This course introduces students to various tools, concepts, and techniques required to model, analyze, understand and make predictions of real-world, complex dynamical systems. They learn abstraction techniques, develop conceptual and mathematical models, and use modern softwares. The course lies at the intersection of computer science, applied mathematics, and sciences. Students learn to develop understanding systems from different disciplines by using computation to simulate and analyze epidemic and rumor spread, random walk, diffusion, financial data, opinion formation, forest fires, etc. Students get exposed to differential equations, probabilistic, cellular automata, and agent-based simulation methods. The course also allows the students to understand modeling techniques' universality, limitations, and challenges.
