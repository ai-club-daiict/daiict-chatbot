DA-IICT’s infrastructure, ranging from various well-equipped laboratories to Resource Centre (which provides online access to major digital libraries, including those of ACM, IEEE, Springer LNCS, JSTOR) matches the general expectations of inter-disciplinary research. Need-based funding is provided for setting up laboratories and acquiring new equipment. The faculty is also encouraged to seek out latest opportunities for research collaboration and funding. Partnerships with industry are a priority for DA-IICT. Besides, all efforts by faculty to participate in bilateral, international and multi-institutional research grants aimed at solving critical problems will be duly supported.
