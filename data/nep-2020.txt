National Education Policy 2020
NEP 2020
The
National Education Policy (NEP)
is a visionary framework designed to transform education by making it more
inclusive, holistic, and future-ready
. Our platform is dedicated to facilitating the
seamless implementation of NEP
, ensuring that its key principles—
equity, flexibility, skill-based learning, and multidisciplinary education
—are effectively integrated across all levels of education. Dhirubhai Ambani Univeristy (DAU-
formerly known as DA-IICT
) has taken multiple initiatives towards the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. University Grants Commission (UGC) has divided the policy into ten broad thrust areas to support the implementation of NEP-2020 at ground level.

Curriculum
Redesign of course curriculum in alignment with NEP 2020 as part of the Curriculum Review Process. Curriculum Review Committees looked at the broader guidelines coming from the National Education Policy (NEP 2020) while designing the new curriculum of our existing UG/PG programs. The curriculum revision has enabled accommodating minor stream such as Robotics and Autonomous Systems. It also includes skill-based courses like exploratory project. Most of the UG programmes follow NCrF, a few programmes are being revised to align with NCrF.
The new curriculum includes experiential learning and extra and co-curricular activities. The rural internship and exploration projects are part of experiential learning. The students develop extracurricular and co-curricular activities that complement academic learning by developing well-rounded individuals with essential life skills. They prepare students for real-world challenges, making them adaptable, confident, and capable professionals and citizens.

Mahatma Gandhi’s vision in Hind Swaraj critiques the Western model of centralized development, linking it to rising inequality, crime, and environmental degradation. He advocated for self-sufficient "village republics" that utilize local resources and decentralized, eco-friendly technologies to meet essential needs. This vision is crucial for India, where 70% of the population resides in rural areas, yet agriculture, employing 51% of the workforce, contributes only 17% to GDP. Persistent rural-urban disparities in health, education, and employment drive migration to cities, making sustainable rural development essential. The Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA) aims to address these challenges by integrating higher education institutions into rural development efforts.
Under the
Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA)
scheme of UGC, DAU has identified five villages to engage the faculty and students of Higher Educational Institutions in understanding rural realities. The objective is to identify & select existing innovative technologies, enable customisation of technologies, or devise implementation methods for innovative solutions, as per the local needs. It shall help to leverage the knowledge base of the educational institutions for effective implementation of various government programmes.
