On the domination number of various algebraic graphs
The examination of graphs associated with various algebraic structures has gained significance in the past twenty years. The study of these graphs offers multiple advantages. Firstly, it allows us to categorize the resulting graphs. Secondly, it enables us to identify algebraic structures that possess isomorphic graphs. Lastly, it helps us understand the interdependence between algebraic structures and their corresponding graphs. One of the most important graph parameter is domination number of graph. The domination number of a graph, representing the minimum number of vertices needed to "dominate" all other vertices, has applications in facility location, network design, and social network analysis. It helps optimize resource allocation, identify key individuals or nodes, and ensure network connectivity or coverage. In this project we want to determine the domination number of some algebraic graphs.

Economic analysis of Vacation Queueing Models with Impatient Customers
Our emphasis will be on the economic implications of vacation queueing models in service systems characterized by customer impatience. Vacation queueing models serve to analyze scenarios in which servers take periodic breaks (or vacations), resulting in interruptions to service availability. In practical applications, such breaks can arise in various settings, including customer service desks, healthcare facilities, manufacturing processes, and telecommunications networks.
We will explore the following aspects of this project
:
1.
The impact of customer decision-making, including behaviors such as balking (leaving without  joining the queue) and reneging (abandoning the queue after a period of waiting).
2.
An analysis of how scheduled service interruptions influence waiting times, customer satisfaction, and overall revenue for managers.
3.
An evaluation of the economic trade-offs between maintaining continuous service and allowing periodic breaks to enhance operational efficiency, which involves assessing key performance metrics such as expected waiting time, queue length, and service utilization.
4.
Recommendations for businesses to minimize losses from customer impatience while balancing workforce efficiency and profitability, emphasizing the importance of effective queue management for cost efficiency and customer retention.

Blockchain Queueing, Fuzzy Queueing System, Queueing Estimation
Blockchain-based queueing systems enhance decentralized service queues by utilizing smart contracts and secure transaction validation. We will examine the following aspects: reducing delays in validation, optimizing job scheduling in blockchain networks, and ensuring fair and secure queuing for resources.
A fuzzy queueing system integrates uncertainty into queue management by employing fuzzy logic instead of relying on deterministic values. This approach is particularly effective in handling imprecise or variable arrival rates and service times. It is applicable in various fields, including healthcare, traffic control, and manufacturing, where conditions can change dynamically. By utilizing this system, it becomes possible to deliver improved predictions even when real-time data is inconsistent.
Queueing estimation involves forecasting expected wait times, service efficiency, and resource allocation in various fields like customer service, call centers, cloud computing, and logistics. We will be using mathematical techniques such as:
Markov Chains for Probabilistic Behavior Analysis
Monte Carlo Simulation for Uncertainty Modeling
Neural Networks & AI for Adaptive Queue Predictions

Queueing games in Healthcare & Communication systems
In this study, we will utilize queueing game models to analyze healthcare and communication systems, with the objective of optimizing resource allocation and user behavior in high-demand scenarios. Our emphasis will be on examining how customers make strategic decisions regarding queueing during periods of congestion.
We will apply Nash equilibrium and strategic interaction models under four different information scenarios to forecast queueing behaviors and develop effective intervention strategies.

User Persona-Aware Evaluation of Large Language Model Safety
In modern deployments, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable prowess across diverse applications, yet their safety remains a pressing concern, particularly as these models interact with users of varied backgrounds, preferences, and risk profile. However, most existing safety‐evaluation benchmarks—such as SafetyBench—treat all users homogenously, ignoring how different user personas may alter a model’s vulnerability to harmful outputs. Concurrently, advances in persona‐aware personalization illustrate that modeling user preferences and behaviors can meaningfully tailor LLM interactions. This project proposes to bridge these domains by developing a User Persona–Aware Evaluation Framework for LLM safety, enabling nuanced assessment of model risks across a spectrum of realistic user profiles. Through constructing representative persona templates, designing persona‐sensitive safety tests, and integrating robust metrics, our framework will drive the next generation of safety evaluations that reflect the diversity of real‐world users.
