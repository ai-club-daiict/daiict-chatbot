Selection of Scholarship Awardees
Scholarships would be offered to the five students with the highest SPI (Semester Performance Index) for the students admitted through Direct Admission of Foreign and NRI Students (DAFS) category (provided that the student satisfies the conditions given below. The Summer Semester is not covered in the scheme; hence a student who does not satisfy a particular condition in the Winter Semester of a particular academic year would not be eligible for the scholarship in the Autumn Semester of the succeeding academic year.
Minimum SPI

The SPI (Semester Performance Index) obtained by the student should be 7.00/10.00 or above in every semester. If the SPI falls below 7.00/10.00 in a particular semester, the scholarship would not be offered in the succeeding semester.

The student should not obtain a grade other than a passing grade in all the courses taken in a semester, i.e. the student should have obtained grade of DE or above for courses with letter grades, and a grade of P for all courses with P/F grades. If the student gets a non-passing grade (ie F/NP/X) in any course of a semester, then he will not be eligible for the scholarship for one succeeding semester.
A student who undertakes some courses of a semester at some other institution under the transfer of credits provision will not be eligible for the scholarship for the succeeding semester.

The student should complete all the degree requirements in the normal duration of study for the program.
