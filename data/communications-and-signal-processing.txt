Research Overview
Research is underway on the design and development of software that generates implementations and solves estimation problems using Kalman filters and its variants. From a high-level mathematical description of a state estimation problem, the software aims to generate code that computes statistically optimal estimate using the appropriate estimation filters. Also being developed are motion analysis algorithms to find relevant motion parameters based on available information, in the presence of relatively high error rates in low SNR conditions.
Research is being carried out for the development of new circuit topologies for wireless communication and radar systems. Specific research topics include: the design and development of miniaturized active integrated antennas, front-ends of wireless communication and radar systems including smart antenna systems; multi-band transceiver design, digital base-band signal processing for wireless communication, multi-band fractal antenna for satellite applications, analysis of radiation from multi-device high-gain amplifier, and interaction of active MMIC with package.
