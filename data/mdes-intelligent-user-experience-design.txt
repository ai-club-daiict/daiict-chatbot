M.Des. (IUxD) Courses
M.Des. Program Overview
The M.Des. Program is a full-time Master’s program offering 2 specializations, namely:
Specialization 1: Master of Design in Communication Design – M.Des. (CD)
Specialization 2: Master of Design in Intelligent User Experience Design M.Des. (IUxD)
Objective of M.Des. (Intelligent User Experience Design)
The Master of Design (M.Des.) in Intelligent User Experience Design (IUxD) is a two-year post-graduate specialization aimed at equipping students with the knowledge, skills, and critical thinking required to create seamless, adaptive, and meaningful digital, physical and phytigal interactions in an era of intelligent and smart technologies. M.Des. (IUxD) specialization focuses on the intersection of technology and human-centered design, encouraging students to explore innovative design products that blend personalization, context-awareness, and anticipatory capabilities. By integrating these ‘intelligent’ elements into UX design, students learn to reduce cognitive load, enhance accessibility, and create user experiences that extend beyond traditional digital interactions.
The objective of M.Des. (IUxD) is to create designers who not only understand the mechanics of intelligent technologies but also critically assess their societal impact. As intelligent systems become more embedded in everyday life, ethical considerations, privacy concerns, and inclusivity play a pivotal role in shaping responsible and trustworthy design solutions. The IUxD curriculum integrates these discussions, enabling students to address challenges related to data security, algorithmic biases, and the ethical implications of automation.
IUxD specialization emphasizes design-driven innovation in conjunction with broad understanding of underlying principle of relevant programming languages and ‘intelligent’ technologies. Students gain an understanding of AI-powered design principles, predictive and generative technologies, and the role of data in crafting meaningful user experiences. Through hands-on projects, industry collaborations, and research-based learning, they develop expertise in designing smart products and services across diverse sectors such as healthcare, education, urban systems, finance, and entertainment.
Ultimately, the M.Des. in IUxD fosters a new generation of designers who can bridge the gap between intelligent technologies and human needs. By shaping intuitive, ethical, and user-centered experiences, graduates of this program will lead the transformation of digital interactions into meaningful, adaptive, and future-ready solutions.

Teaching Methodology
In M.Des. program, each course is not a stand-alone learning experience but it is expected that in the course of study the connections, both vertically and horizontally are made by the student that culminates in their project in the final semester.
The teaching approach for each course comprises a combination of lectures, seminars, studio, and practical sessions. The lectures would mainly focus on basic ideas and concepts, which would be substantiated and discussed through seminars, engaging students in active participation in project work. Lecture sequences in a course may be conducted by multiple faculties, and the seminars would be designed to provide a bridge between the lectures and the studio and practical sessions. Emphasis would be that students learn how to learn, what is needed, and when it is needed; in an environment of ever-changing needs and technologies. For each course, the emphasis would be on research and project work that utilizes the methods and ideas learned from other courses. The final student project worth 18 credits must be completed in the fourth semester.
