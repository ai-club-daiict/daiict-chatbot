B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with Minors
DA-IICT offers a unique four-year undergraduate program in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) leading to the degree of:
B.Tech. (ICT)
B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT
B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems
ICT embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. It is also expected that ICT graduates would enjoy a special niche only if they have certain performance capabilities not found in conventional CSE and/or ECE graduates. Logically this convergence takes place at the systems level, but at the same time it is necessary to accept a certain level of granularity as one goes down to the level of circuits, devices and materials. All programs are designed to operate on a semester-based framework that follows choice-based credit system.
The B.Tech. (ICT) program provides a lot of flexibility and choice to students. Students may choose to do more coursework and graduate with
(a) B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT
Apart from satisfying all credit/course/internship/project requirements stipulated for the B.Tech. (ICT) program, the B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT requires a student to complete a minimum of 15 additional credits (and a minimum of five additional courses) in the form of electives. The electives available for the Honours program shall be specified by the Dean-AP, and the flexibility to choose honours qualified elective courses starts from the fourth semester of the program. The students do not have to sign up for this program, and any student who meets the criteria listed below at the time of graduation will be conferred with the B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT degree.
All requirements for B.Tech. (ICT) program
Additional minimum 5 designated courses/15 credits.
Passed in these additional 5 courses.
Minimum final CPI of 6.5.
(b) B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with Minor in a Particular Area
Depending on the faculty resources and student interest, the institute offers a Minor in a particular area to students of the B.Tech. (ICT) program. This will enable students to pursue an in-depth study into an area within ICT or get introduced to an area which complements ICT.
Apart from satisfying all credit/course/internship/project requirements stipulated for the B.Tech(ICT) program, the B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with Minor requires a student to complete a minimum of 15 additional credits (and a minimum of five additional courses) in the form of electives which are aligned with the area in which the Minor is offered. The courses under any Minor begin in Semester 4 and can culminate in Semester 7, and may involve a sequence of Core courses, Elective courses, and/or project based courses. The first Minors program offered by the Institute is the Minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems(RAS), and was offered to the batch of B.Tech. (ICT) 2021 students. The eligibility criteria to enrol in each Minor and criteria to successfully complete the Minor are specific to each Minor. It is to be noted that the B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with Minor in Computational Science is a separate program, and should not be considered as a Minor under this section for all operational purposes. The description, benefits, eligibility criteria, criteria for successful completion, and detailed course content for each Minor can be found

Program Outcomes (POs) & Course Outcomes (COs) of The Program
Syllabus of The Program
The course structure of the curriculum is broadly classified into four categories.
Foundation or Core Courses
Set of compulsory courses taken by every student for first five semesters. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, as well as courses in Humanities, Mathematics and Basic Sciences
Elective Courses
These courses add to both, the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the program. The students can choose the elective courses from the available ones from fifth semester onwards. The elective courses are grouped into the following categories
ICT Electives
Technical Electives
Humanities and Social Sciences Electives
Science Electives
Open Electives
Internships and BTech Projects
Students will do a rural internship during the third semester winter break at NGO or Government Organization. The students will do an industrial or research internship during the summer break in the end of their 6th semester. Finally the student will take a semester long on-campus project (BTP) or the off-campus project – Industrial Training Project (ITP).
Co-curricular Activities and Exploration Project
Co-curricular activities are non-class activities like sports, cultural and technical club activities. These courses run over the first four semesters and are graded Pass/Fail.
Exploration projects allow students to explore their surroundings to identify interesting problems that admit a design based and/or hardware based solution and make such a product by leveraging the introduction to ICT skills learnt in the first semester. Students are expected to work in groups of 8 to 10 under a faculty mentor over two semesters - second and third semester. This course will be graded on a Pass/Fail basis.
A unique feature of the program is the mandatory rural internship, which is expected to give the student a feel of his/her social milieu and is typically carried out with an NGO and Govt. organizations. The rural internship is offered in the Winter break after the 3rd semester. After the completion of foundation courses, the student is required to take a 6-8 week mandatory industrial/research internship, which is offered in the summer break after the 6th semester. The student has a choice of taking an industrial internship or a research internship depending on his/her career goals. The student is required to take at least a semester long BTech project (BTP), during which he/she is required to demonstrate his/her ability to learn current areas of research and/or industrial interest. Furthermore, a student has option to do BTP as on-campus or off-campus mode, where the on-campus mode allows the student to explore his/her research interest under the supervision of a faculty, whereas the off-campus mode allows the student in getting exposure to industry and/or other R&D organizations/universities.
Most of the foundation courses are offered in the first four semesters and a part of the fifth semester. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, as well as courses in Humanities, Mathematics and Basic Sciences. In the remaining 3 and a half semesters, students take elective courses and do internships and projects.
The curriculum accommodates 148 credits, out of which 129 credits for courses and 19 credits for internships and project work. In addition, there are 6 credits for Co-curricular Activities courses and Exploratory Projects. Out of the 129 required coursework credits, 90 credits are allocated to compulsory courses (Foundation courses) and 39 credits are allocated to four kinds of electives (12 credits are allocated to ICT electives, 12 credits to Technical electives, 6 credits to Science electives, 3 credits to HASS elective and 6 credits to Open electives), which the student can choose according to his/her inclination and interest. Honours students also take additional five courses from the designation basket and obtain a minimum of 15 credits.
Honours in ICT and Honours in ICT with Minor
The B.Tech. (ICT) program offers an option to interested students to pursue additional course work and graduate with an Honours degree. The additional course work could be in a particular area of interest decided by the institute or could be spread across several different areas of knowledge. Upon successfully completing the requirements of the B.Tech. (ICT) program and the additional course work requirements, in the former scenario, the student graduates with a B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with a Minor in the particular area, while in the latter case, the student graduates with a B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT degree. The additional course work required in both cases is 5 courses (and minimum 15 credits). More details are available

.
Semester-wise course sequence
Each course is associated with a fixed number of credits. Credits are awarded on an L-T-P-C system (C=L+T+P/2) per semester, that is, the number of contact hours for Lectures (L), Tutorials (T) and Practical (P) in a week. Nominally, since a semester has around 13–14 weeks of classes, therefore, a 3 credit lecture course would amount to approximately 40 lecture hours in a semester.

B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT with Minor in Robotics and Autonomous Systems
Robotics and Autonomous Systems(RAS) are a fascinating and fast-paced field that is changing how we work and live. Robotics and autonomous systems is an interdisciplinary technology that significantly impacts many vital applications, such as Industry 4.0, Cyber-physical systems, transportation, aerospace, defence, and healthcare. Robots are typically physical systems that carry out predetermined operations. On the other hand, autonomous systems are sophisticated systems that can operate alone in their environment and complete various challenging tasks. Examples include autonomous vehicles, intelligent manufacturing robots, drones, wheeled mobile robots, humanoid robots, and surgical robots. These fields have grown significantly in the last five years and are expected to increase further. As a result, the demand for qualified professionals with an in-depth understanding of computer science, machine learning, artificial intelligence, adaptive control, multi-agent systems, electronics, and many other cutting-edge disciplines are acute in both industry and academia
This minor degree provides an extensive theoretical understanding and hands-on experience in developing, controlling and programming robotic platforms and autonomous systems. The students must take core/group-elective courses in the areas of robotics and autonomous systems such as Robot Programming, Mechatronics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, IoT, Edge Computing, Computer Vision, and AR-VR. The minor will provide you with expertise in
Robot Operating Systems
Robot Programming
Drone Technology
Automation devices and sensors
