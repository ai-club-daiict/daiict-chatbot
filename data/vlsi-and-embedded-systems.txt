Research Overview
An important component of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is the Electronics and Communication, VLSI and Embedded systems (VES). The VES research group of ICT department in DA-IICT encompasses wide range of spectrum from microelectronics, digital and analog system architectures, VLSI electronic-design automation, nanotechnology, embedded systems and designs.
DA-IICT has excellent research laboratories with the availability of various state-of-the-art CAD tools for VES. The core research areas and on-going projects are in the areas of
Low power processor design, high performance using ARM processors, edge computing
Ultra-low power, ultra-low voltage IC design
Embedded systems and IoT
MEMS (Nano/Micro sensors)
Nanoelectronics and nanotechnology
AI/ML chip design robotics, system cybernetics
Circuits and systems – design, modeling and simulation, graphene FETs and on-chip interconnects
Machine learning for VLSI architectures
The VES research group has led to various publications in Book chapters, Journals and Conferences of repute, bringing several funded projects and incubation of many start-ups.
DA-IICT has a strong research group, relevant curriculum, expertise faculties and dedicated labs for supporting various Ph.D. and M.Tech. students in VLSI and Embedded systems specialization. The department provides wide range of core VLSI/Embedded systems subjects together with many electives from other domains such as machine learning, signals and systems, IoT, computational theory to make the programme more comprehensive and dynamic. The department is committed in delivering both excellences in teaching and high quality research.
