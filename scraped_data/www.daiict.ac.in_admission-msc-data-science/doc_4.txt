Interdisciplinary programmes and departments involved All our programmes are interdisciplinary nature, as ICT itself captures interdisciplinary curricula of Information Technology, Communications Technology and Electronics Engineering. These three domains constitute the hybridity of ICT as an innovative knowledge system at the undergraduate and postgraduate engineering. The curriculum of UG and PG programmes involves innovative strands from Humanities and Social Science courses, namely, Cultural Studies, Art and Science Fiction, Management, Finance, Economics and Environment, Animation, Film, Design, Graphic Design and Multimedia systems. Students of every programme undertake semester long project under the supervision of faculty based on students choice. This enables students and faculty to work in a true interdisciplinary environment. The curriculum of every programme provides adequate rooms for electives offerings, where faculty members from different specializations can offer courses on his/her field of interests. 6. Courses in collaboration with other universities, industries, foreign institutions, etc. None. DAIICT is unitary University. 7. Details of programmes discontinued, if any, with reasons None. 8. Examination System: Annual / Semester / Trimester / Choice Based Credit system Semester which follows Choice Based Credit System All our programmes follow semester based examination system which adopts Choice Based Credit System (CBCS). Students are given adequate flexibility in selecting courses they like to consider for their electives and have them count towards their graduation credit requirements. In every course of the programmes, the instructor announces to students about the grading policy and the distribution of weightage in NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 4 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology different components in the courses that the instructor is going to follow to assess the students performance in the course. The performance of the students is assessed on a continuous evaluation mechanism by assessing their performance in in-semester examinations, end-semester examinations, assignments, quizzes, student presentations and projects. A minimum of 80% attendance is required for students to appear in the end semester examinations. After evaluation, the answer books are shown to the students so that they can see where they have made mistakes and discuss with the instructor accordingly. The semester result is announced within a week after the end semester examination. In every semester, students accumulate their semester performance index (SPI) on a 10-point scale, and then the SPI is accumulated in their cumulative performance index (CPI) on a 10-point scale that will show their academic performance during their study as well as at the end of their graduation. The institute maintains a fully online E-Campus system to manage students records such as semester-wise course list, student registration, approval processes, result announcement, grading, and reflection of students SPI and CPI in their grade sheets. The E-Campus system is owned by the Registrars office of the institute and the entire processes of evaluation and grading system of all our academic programmes are fully transparent to students and faculty. 9. Participation of the department in the courses offered by other departments All our programmes are interdisciplinary in nature, running under Information and Communication Technology as a discipline. As a result, participation of a large number of elective courses of one programme to other is a need by the design of the programme curriculum. Most of the electives in one programme are open other programmes. The electives consist of the set of technical electives, science electives and open electives. Faculty members actively participate in offering internships and projects to UG and PG students within and outside the curriculum requirement. This is perhaps the unique characteristic of all our programmes that effectively converges students and faculty participation to one discipline, that is, Information and Communication Technology.

Code of ethics for research followed by the departments Being a research led teaching Institute, DAIICT takes the pride of those faculty members, technical staffs and a large section of under graduate and post graduate students take part in active research. DAIICT attracts considerably large amount towards funding of various projects conceived by the faculty members. The quality maintained is quite high and meeting national and international standards. The code of ethics for research as mentioned below provides an articulation of the values and principles underlying the institutes research investigation methodologies. This code of ethics is expected to be a source of supports and confidence to the faculty members, a reassurance to all staffs participating in research projects and an indicator of quality to those who use and consult the corresponding research reports. Role and Responsibilities  Protect the dignity and wellbeing of self and all stakeholders such as research participants, collaborators, funding agencies and the institute.  Avoid exploiting personal relations, rather stick to the high professional ethics.  Be sensitive to the issues and problems of society while framing the research problems, collecting information, conducting experiments and interpreting results and findings.  Maintain and keep all the records arising out of the research to handle quarries that are to be answered in appropriate manner for future.  Discuss results of research only for professional purpose, and only with those who are clearly entitled to know or be consulted. Promoting High Standards  Ensure that highest quality and standards are maintained in problem framing, experiments and reporting of results.  Do not compromise with the quality of research and the outcomes that provides undue advantage to any individual or group of individuals.  Utmost care should be taken while reporting results such that nothing can be misinterpreted and misused against the development of society at large.  All parties involved should be informed in time for conflict of interest, if any. NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 48 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Avoidance of Infringement  Take care that there is no infringement of any published work while reporting research results.  Avoiding plagiarism is must. Take utmost care against informed or uninformed plagiarism. Whenever and wherever necessary, try to get the consent from the appropriate authority. In case consent could not be received, appropriate acknowledgement should be made.  Plagiarism check and an ethical review is must before publishing any document related to research. Privacy and Confidentiality  Explore and collect only that information which is appropriate to the purpose of a given investigation or intervention.  Take care that there is no discomfort, while conducting the research, on the personally or culturally defined space of any person including stake holders and research participants unless clear and appropriate permission is granted to do so.  Do not relay, except justified by law, confidential information about any stakeholders to which it has become privy in the course of research.  Inform those to whom services are offered about legal limits on confidentiality where it is appropriate to do so. Avoiding Harm  Do not engage in research that promotes or intended to create discomfort to any individual or group of individuals.  Avoid doing research that directly or indirectly cause harm to any species.  Do not take up any issue of research that may affect the harmony of the society or causes problem towards integrity to any individual, group of individuals or as whole the society.

However, through interaction with student community and placement cell, it is estimated that at least 15 percent of the graduating students go for further studies. Out of the candidates going for further studies, around 60 percent go for management courses and the others apply for MS/M.Tech/PhD degrees both within the country and outside, and so must have taken NET / SAT / GATE /CAT / GRE / TOFEL / GMAT). Very few opt for Civil Services and Defense Services examinations. DA-IICT Alumni web portal (https://daiict.almaconnect.com/) will allow us to better track the student profile after graduation. 35.

Was any need assessment exercise undertaken before the development of new programme(s)? If so, highlight the methodology. Development of any new programme at DAIICT is a multi-stage rigorous process with the following stages: 1. Feasibility Study This stage includes academic viability, market demand, and faculty capability analysis. In addition Institute also performs physical and academic infrastructure requirement analysis and financial analysis. 2. Requirement and Benchmark Study In this stage, peer programmes across the globe are studied for establishing benchmarks for program input, objectives, and outcomes. NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 74 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3. Model Curricula Design A detailed analysis of peer curricula is done along with study of reference curricula if any. Institutes vision and requirement study results are used as guides for preparing a detailed curriculum for the programme. 4. Internal and External Feedback Study Representatives of all the stake holders, including students, faculty, industry, experts from peer academic institutes, and alumni are engaged in brain storming the curriculum and based on these inputs, curriculum proposal is prepared for the presentation to the faculty and later to the academic council 5. Formal Evaluation and Ratification by the Academic Council Academic council gives the final approval. The approved curriculum is used as a frame work for devising operational elements such as specific course content creation, lab design etc. In 2013, DAIICT introduced a new program of B.Tech (ICT) Hons. with a minor in Computational Science. In 2015, two new specializations are added in the M.Tech(ICT) program. These specializations are i) Algorithmics and ii) Signal Processing. It is to be noted that DAIICT already offers M.Tech (ICT) programme with specializations in VLSI and Embedded Systems, Communications Systems, Computer Networks and Machine Intelligence. 42. Does the department obtain feedback from a) faculty on curriculum as well as teaching-learning-evaluation? If yes, how does the department utilize the feedback? b) students on staff, curriculum and teaching-learning-evaluation and how does the department utilize the feedback? c) alumni and employers on the programmes offered and how does the department utilize the feedback? Yes, the institute has a well-defined mechanism in place to obtain feedback from students, faculty, alumni and employers. A feedback form is circulated to each of NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 75 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology the student for all the courses he/she has registered for the semester before the semester ends. The duration of course evaluation by student is also included in the Academic calendar. The exit feedback is collected from all students when they complete their academic requirements for the degree. The campus placement process collects feedback of employers time to time. All feedback forms are accumulated and compiled by the Dean(AP) office. The compiled feedback result is then communicated to the Director for assessment. The feedback provided by the stakeholders is used for improvement in courses and delivery mechanism, and is also discussed in faculty meetings for improvement in respective programmes. a. faculty on curriculum as well as teaching-learning-evaluation? If yes, how does the department utilize the feedback? The curriculum devise/revise of all our programmes goes through multiple rigorous discussions and brain storming sessions by faculty body. Once faculty body clears the draft curriculum of a programme then it goes to the Academic Council for approval. The entire process of new curriculum formulation or existing curriculum revision is coordinated by Board of Studies. The teaching-learning and evaluation process is carried out throughout the academic year. All the courses follow choice based credit system. As a result, the teaching practice is structured into Theory-Tutorial-Practical (L-T-P). For example, a course with 3-0-2-4 indicates that the course will have weekly 3 hours of lectures and 2 hours of practical, and the student who has registered for this course will earn 4 credits (note: 2 hours of practical give 1 credit).In the classrooms, the teaching aids involve computer, white board, overhead projector, document camera, and audio system. Course instructor use lecture notes, slides presentations and discussion with students through assignments and projects. Continuous assessment of each course is done throughout the semester. The instructor announces the assessment mechanism and grading policy in the first week of the semester. Typically, in-semester exams, end semester exam, quizzes, assignments, in-class participation are some of the measures that NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 76 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology help in assessing students performance. The entire course registration, course grading and semester-wise transcript is managed online by the institute through its E-campus system. Both students and faculty can access the authorized module with their respective credentials. The Dean office of Academic Programs in consultations with UG committee and PG committee discuss matters related to academic improvements, collect feedback from all stakeholders and address all concerns which help in improving the academic process of the institute. b. students on staff, curriculum and teaching-learning-evaluation and how does the department utilize the feedback? The institute has a proper mechanism through which course feedback of students is collected for all courses in every semester. The course feedback form is circulated to each of the student for all the courses he/she has registered for before the semester ends. The course evaluation period is also announced in the Academic calendar. All feedback forms are accumulated and compiled by the Dean(AP) office. The compiled feedback result is then submitted to the Director for review. The course instructors also receive the summarized feedback for each of their courses which help them to incorporate deficiencies in his/her course, if any. In addition, the programme exit survey questionnaire is collected from every student after completion of his/her credits requirements. The feedback provided by the students is used for improvement in courses and delivery mechanism, and is also discussed in faculty meetings for further improvement in the curriculum. c. alumni and employers on the programmes offered and how does the department utilize the feedback? The institute collects feedback from alumni about the programmes, course delivery, and infrastructure. The alumni board meets periodically and opines on various activities such as programmes, curricula, placement, faculty, staff, infrastructure and juniors. The board consists of faculty representatives who brought the feedback of alumni to Dean(AP)s and Directors notice. The NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 77 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology institute also collects feedback from employers through its placement process. Employers suggest the need of curriculum updation and introduction of new courses to keep pace of industry requirement. Employers feedback is then communicated to Director through the faculty convenor of Placement office. The institute utilizes all the feedback of alumni and employers, which are being discussed with faculty and with respective concerned people to improve the academic activities. 43.

The institute has adopted the following universal mechanisms to make the teaching- learning process student-centric. - Class room lecturing - Project based learning - Assignments and Lab practices - Peer discussion - Participation in students clubs - Research paper study and student presentation - Self-study  applicable to PhD and M.Tech students - Internships - Extra-curricular activities Two major challenges in an effective teaching pedagogy are large class size and easy availability of online study material. Large classes are challenging for simultaneously handling the needs of a relatively diverse audience, effective interactivity, and ensuring attentiveness of the students. Availability of online study materials creates a perception that face to face lecture time may not be required at all and has the added benefit of flexible timings. In large classes that we teach, faculty have found that an ICT tool like personal response system (PRS) is very helpful in real-time interactivity and thus the possibility of change in teaching emphasis on the fly. We also find that breaking the NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 83 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology lecture in 3 fifteen minutes capsules with interactive games and quizzes of five minutes each greatly enhances the alertness level and the comprehension of the students. Some faculty have experimented with flipped classroom methodology for teaching advanced technical electives with small enrolment levels. Wikipedia defines flipped classroom as an instructional strategy and a type of blended learning that reverses the traditional educational arrangement by delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom and moves activities, including those that may have traditionally been considered homework, into the classroom We have found that by providing the study material, including lecture notes, online videos, and research papers for the students to study on their own before they come to class, the lectures can be turned into problem solving, ideation, and brain-storming sessions. This has resulted in an enhanced satisfaction level of the students for the course and a superior achievement of the learning outcomes. Another interesting mechanism used in some courses is the use of narratives. In some of the humanities and social sciences courses, concepts are taught through anecdotes and real life news rather than only theories. In other words, the pedagogical approach is that of storytelling. All concepts are taught by narrating stories or relating them with everyday incidences. The advantage is that, students remember the concepts for much longer time. Our faculty is continuously looking for innovation in pedagogical devices that best fit the individual characteristics of the courses and the students. 46. How does the department ensure that programme objectives are constantly met and learning outcomes are monitored? The institute is committed to deliver outcome based quality education and to produce self-reliant knowledge pool by practicing an effective teaching-learning mechanism and producing novel research out comes through a dedicated faculty body, state-of- the-art infrastructure and support of the academic administration. The institute has recently constituted an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC), which along with various internal committees, guided by the Board of Studies and the Academic NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 84 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Council can assure standards and quality in all the matters related to academic processes. The academic calendar of the institute is prepared by the Registrar in consultation with the Dean(AP) and get it approved by the Academic Council prior to the academic year. The calendar outlines the semester schedule, examinations schedule, and course evaluation schedule. The course allocation to faculty for the academic year is prepared by the Dean (AP), with the input of faculty, UG and PG committees, and informed to students prior to the registration of a semester. The timetable of Lectures, Labs and Tutorials is made available to students, faculty and staff well in advance before the commencement of a semester. Most of the instructors communicate to students about the lesson plan, topics to be covered including methodology and the evaluation process for the course at the beginning of the semester. The performance of the students is assessed on a continuous basis by conducting in- semester exams, end-semester exam, assignments, quizzes, student presentations, and projects. A minimum of 80% attendance is required in each course for appearing for the end semester examination. After evaluation, the answer books are shown to the students so that they can see where they have made mistakes and discuss with the instructor accordingly. The semester result is announced within a week after the end semester examination. Dean(AP), UG committee and PG committee continuously monitor all academic activities. They discuss with faculty and Director for all concerns pertaining to programme objectives and outcomes. The alumni of the institute have already established the brand of DA-IICT in industry, R&D organizations and other institutions in India and abroad about the quality education offered at the institute. With a dedicated faculty team, high-caliber students input, excellent infrastructure, and the enriching curriculum of the programmes, the institute is able to produce graduates with adequate knowledge and hands-on skills in information and communication technology by which they can establish themselves as successful professionals in industry and R&D organisations. As a result, the institute ensures that programme objectives are constantly met and learning outcomes are supervised NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 85 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology throughout the academic calendar. 47. Highlight the participation of students and faculty in extension activities During the rural internship, students often carry out surveys to help NGOs in setting the baseline conditions. In fact, the NGOs have been helped in developing teaching modules, training workers, writing up small software programs, preparing documentation and many more activities by the students during the rural internship because the students devote one full month to the NGOs to carry out whatever work they have. In addition, the Institute has helped many voluntary organizations in designing their programs with its expertise so that they could reach the underprivileged more effectively. For example, four students did their BTP project for AkshayPatra, to chart out optimal path for the vans that reach out to almost 1 lakh students in various schools. Similarly, the governments e-gram centers were helped by the students in sprucing up their facilities  first the needs assessment for the rural population was done and later software programs were developed to be included in the e-gram network. Our students have helped deaf and dumb school by gathering videos and educational games for their students and conducting training for the instructors, developed a software for a small bank in Saurashtra for its human resource management because it had no access to such programs, carried out surveys regarding environment effects of Mundra port for Center for Environment Education, and such. The examples are too many to site here because many different courses  technical as well as social science  include such exercises that reach out to the outside community. One more example was to examine how do we represent health as a problem, defined by a community which allows for community activism and agency and yet can be seen as a policy problem. What one basically learnt from the conversations is that design can mediate between the right to Information and the possibilities of representation. Mere transparency does not guarantee the right to information about health. It needs a competence to play with parameters of health to effect new connections and consequent changes in policy. Design thus becomes a methodological tool not just for policy but peoples engagement with it. If Design is NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 86 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology connectivity, one had to see all the relations that exist about health - connectivities between health and water, health and land, natural resources, agriculture, food consumption including policies were established in the project that became the key connections through which health of a community were monitored. The project was driven largely with an aim to work on prevention rather than cure, and finally one needed to capture the dynamic conditions between altered conditions. If health was change, one needed to understand the changing relations between agricultural practices and consumption of food and/or water and health. Design also took into account time and the long duree of health. For example one could increase resistance to sickle cell even if one could not eliminate it. The project was conceived as a system that would be monitored by the community themselves. In addition, the faculty members have worked as advisers in policy formulation, as an extension activity of their own knowledge. Some examples of such activities would be:  As advisor to the Govt on policy formations, Professor Vishwajit Pandya advices and formulates policies in collaboration with the PVTG tribal groups of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  Prof Alka Parikh was a member of Working Group of Planning Commission of India for both 11th and 12th Five Year Plans. She worked on the policies for agriculture in the 11th plan and on disaster management preparation plans for the 12th plan.  Prof Alka Parikh helps the staff of Utthan (as a member of board of Trustees) and Uplift India Association (as a Joint Director) in formulating their programs for rural development. She also advises the Centre for Social Studies, Surat, as a member of the Governing Board.  Prof Hiremath is a board member for Jaipur Rug Foundation.  Prof Aditi Nath Sarkar is the Member of the Governing Council, Satyajit Ray Film& Television Institute (SRFTI) (An Academic Institution of Ministry of I&B Govt.of India) NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 87 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Youth Run Youth run was an initiative by a group of students who wanted to promote good health, camaraderie and social awareness. The Youth run vision was to run for a social cause. The run was held every year for three years in the month of February. DA-IICT Students, many from the Gandhinagar community and local school children would participate in a 4km or 8km run in the wee hours of the morning. Around 1000 persons running together in cold during the early morning early made a wonderful scene. The run usually ended with some light snacks and a talk and interaction session with an imminent person on a theme related to social awareness. Profits of Youth run were given to an NGO. 48. Give details of beyond syllabus scholarly activities of the department. The institute constitutes (through a normal election process) a dynamic Students Body Government (SBG) which coordinates many extension activities through various students clubs. Each student club is mentored by a faculty in which interested students can actively participate for software development, programming, web development, electronics hobby and so on. Various Technical Clubs at DA-IICT are: 1. Programming Club (Aryans) - a platform to enrich the concepts of computer hardware and software. 2. Electronics Hobby Center (EHC)  hardware explorations. 3. Microsoft Student Technical Club (MSTC). 4. Communication and Networks Club. 5. Web Development Club (WebDev) 6. Google Developers Group (GDG) Students also actively participate in IEEE student branch and ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) student branch at the institute. NAAC Evaluative Report - 2015 88 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology With active participation in national and international forums, our students have received many prestigious awards such as Texas Instruments DSP Design, Microsoft Imagine Cup, Red Hat Challenge, HP Innovate, Google Summer of Code, TCS-100 Best Student, Google India Women and many more.
