Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA- IICT), is a premier private university imparting quality technical education in the ICT domain. It is the most sought after Institute for any student willing to pursue his/her education in ICT domain. During the 15+ years of its existence, the Institute has been striving hard to provide quality education at affordable cost to its aspirants. Armed with the state of the infrastructure, eminent and visionary advisory bodies, distinguished faculty, proactive management, total autonomy in governance, unique curriculum and vibrant student community, DA-IICT has carved a niche for itself in the national/international league of institutions imparting quality technical education. The same is evident and demonstrated time and again against the various quality evaluations metrics such as: 1. Quality of Graduates 2. Research Output 3. Sponsored and Consortium Projects 4. Placement Statistics 5. Entrepreneurship Initiatives 6. Mentoring an Indian Institute of Information Technology(IIIT) 7. Design and rendering of high quality teacher training initiatives 8. Organization of international seminars/workshops/summer schools/winter schools/conferences on regular basis 9. Collaborations and MoUs with National/International Organizations 10. Social Outreach 11. Environment Consciousness 12. Innovations Ample evidence towards, DA-IICT achieving excellence in all the aforesaid parameters of evaluation is available in the public domain and also enumerated in detail in the Self Study Report (SSR). 10 Self evaluation and self appraisal are the most powerful tools available for any institute striving towards quality enhancement and future planning. The SSR format prepared by NAAC, in true sense, is the most comprehensive document available in public domain, which provides the framework to any educational institution to perform an internal assessment and auditing. The process for writing the SSR for DA-IICT was really an unique experience. The innumerable brain storming sessions amongst the various stakeholders demonstrated amply their passion, ownership and love towards the Institute. Inclusive participation of all the stakeholders resulted in creating an honest, genuine and introspective SSR. While performing this exercise, the core team involved in the preparation of the SSR also conducted an internal evaluation and grading of the Institute. A mock visit by inviting an external expert of eminence was also organized. The SSR was submitted to NAAC in October, 2015. The first visit was conducted during 11th April to 14th April, 2016. In the upcoming sections we present a criterion wise addendum to the SSR submitted in October, 2015. Only incremental data since October, 2015 is added in the tabulation, while retaining the philosophy of SSR. 11 12 CRITERION I: CURRICULAR ASPECTS 1.2.2 Give details on the following provisions with reference to academic flexibility a.

Mention any significant efforts which have improved the process and functioning of the examination division/section. The Office of the Controller of Examination(CoE) has introduced Question Paper Upload System (QPUS) for online submission of question paper. The system is locally configured on Moodle server which allows the users (pre- defined) to upload the question papers pertaining to their courses. The QPUS system facilitates auto-email notification feature which sends two-way communication (faculty as well as CoE) on any action taken by the course instructors. The QPUS is made accessible on intranet with the restricted IP range 16 and based on the registered users credentials. The QPUS permits the user for uploading multiple question papers (upto 10 files) with the capacity of 20 Mbs for each course. The QPUS also provides feature of adding comments, which allows the user to mention any special instruction related to Question Paper printing. The CoE can set the deadlines of Question Paper submission for the faculty which helps the timely submission of question papers. The QPUS also auto-generates the depository of all the question papers uploaded into the system. The system generates log of each action taken by user which can be used by the authority for audit as and when required. 2.6.3 How are the universitys teaching, learning and assessment strategies structured to facilitate the achievement of the intended learning outcomes? 17 Pass percentage: * No. of students appeared include previous batch students who failed in some courses. + No. of students passed include previous batch students who failed in some courses.

Innovations H. Title of the Project: Tuberculosis Eradication and Awareness Name of the Investigators: Prof. Anil K. Roy, Abhishek Jani, Nishant Raval, Bhavik Bansali Sponsoring Agency: TCS Digital Impact Square Novelty in the project: It would be an electronic pill dispensing device which would remind the patient to take the medicine daily and would also record the data if or not the patient has taken the medicine. In case the patient does not take the medicine, the device informs the hospital authority about it. The hospital then would like to contact the patient over phone to ensure the continuity. We expect some encouraging result by the year end of 2017. It is an electronic pill-dispensing device with following features: The device has an internal cabinet with 14 sections for scheduling medicines (the left most figure). The middle figure depicts a tamper proof locking system. And the LCD panel to set alarm and LED system is shown in the right figure. 68 There is a rotation drive, motor system to rotate the medicine dispensing system for taking out pills without unlocking it, as shown in the left figure. The central figure shows the position/tilt sensor to confirm whether or not the medicine has been taken out of the device. GSM Communication module to send alerts of tracking is depicted in the right figure. For sending alerts, we needed an input signal from the basic device which should trigger our controller. This is tapped from the motor given in the left figure. The central figure is the photo of the controller that actuates an RTC (Real Time Clock) that keeps record of time and throws this data on set intervals. This controller has a power support system (right figure) that changes its status from sleep mode to wake up mode as programmed. Communication port sends alerts to our users: Patients, caretaker of the patient, doctor, Nashik Municipal Corp Commissioner, super admin of this project. All the above is maintained in a Dashboard on the server in form of the T-BEAD portal [Status: work on the Dashboard has been started and is expected to be complete by mid-term phase] Index of success / Outreach: This project is expected to be a breakthrough in the Government of Indias mission of eliminating TB by 2025. W e have given our presentation to WHO officials of Maharashtra and it has been considered to be an outstanding boon for TB patients of India. It will strengthen the cause of Unite to End TB campaign of WHO. I. Title of the Project: Wearable thermometer and Vitals Measurement Names of the investigators: Ankur Pokhara and Prof. Biswajit Mishra Sponsoring Agency: DAIICT Seed Fund & DST-GUJCOST Gujarat Novelty in the project: A wearable device is made that checks your body temperature every 34 seconds and beams the data to any android phone used for the purpose. The device is designed like a watch and can be worn on the wrist. The watch has a special clinical thermal sensor 69 that remains in constant touch with your skin. This replaces the need for attendants to monitor temperature. The device is designed like a watch and can be worn on the wrist. The watch has a special clinical thermal sensor that remains in constant touch with your skin. Today, a change in body temperature can be linked to numerous health issues such as heart disease, obesity or diabetes and even fainting fits in children. The thermo-sensor watch can even be extended to the dairy industry for monitoring livestock to check for signs of disease, besides its primary use in home-based clinical applications. The cost is almost one-fourth of similar technology available in the market. In hospitals, wearable temperature recording devices replace the need for attendants or caregivers to monitor temperature. In large dairy farms it becomes critical for the farmer to keep track of the body temperatures of their livestock, which influences milk production. Some of the new versions of the wearable intelligent thermometer are embedded with tiny solar cells so that the device attains energy autonomy. Right now the device just has a coin sized battery to power the wearable device, which does not need a replacement for a little above two years. Index of success/outreach: We have had reasonable success with the wearable device both on the human beings and cattle. We have tested the device at a few health centers around Gandhinagar where the outliers have been a major challenge for the widespread adoption of the technology. However the wearable device on the cattle is proving out to be a useful device for the farmers with the feasibility carried out in collaboration with NDDB and AAU, Anand. 70 7.3 Best Practices Title of the Practice: Rural internship for the B.Tech students A total of 43 NGOs participated in the rural internship program in 2016, with 31 of those in Gujarat. A total of 296 students signed up for these NGOs, again with a vast majority (188) opting for an NGO in Gujarat. Besides Gujarat, students went to work with NGOs in U.P., H.P., M.P., Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, A.P., and Maharashtra. Students' work during 3.5 weeks in December can be roughly categorized as follows: 1. Child education and development: surveying the current state of Aanganwadi (pre- primary), primary and secondary level education in the village schools, helping the village educators improve the math and science teaching programs, inculcating better values and discipline (hygiene, staying away from vices and addiction, etc.) in the children, providing a basic training in using the computers to the school-going children, etc. 2. Agricultural and Dairy related initiatives: surveying the farmer's needs and complaints (e.g., water scarcity, scarcity of fertilizers), providing the information about good farming practices and scientific approach, surveying the animal husbandry in the villages, providing suggestions regarding how to use the technology to increase the efficiency of production, etc. 3. Women and children empowerment: participating in NGO-led programs for self- sustainability of women (by handicrafts, etc.), prevention of child labor and child abuse, surveying the women participating in Government based financial assistance schemes, their knowledge about the bank accounts, ATM and cashless transactions, etc. 4. Health based initiatives: survey of villagers about their BMI and susceptibility to Diabetes, survey of their hygiene and involvement in Swatchh Bharat campaign, survey of the use of the toilets provided by the Government and the NGOs, help in the daily activities of several hospitals run by some of the NGOs, etc. 5. Help to the disabled: two groups of students worked with two different NGOs that are doing excellent work in helping the physically and mentally disabled villagers 71 Title of the Practice: e-campus Objectives: 1. To make online the examination paper submission system 2. To improve the online students project management system 3. To construct a students services portal system that handles all the service demands of the students Context: The purpose was to make as many systems online as possible so that the manual handling reduces. For exam papers, this ensures confidentiality. For project management, it makes it transparent and easily accessible to all the examiners. The portal also aims to make the paper based forms outdated. The students can apply for transcripts or gowns or identity cards online. The practice: When question papers are submitted manually, they pass through many hands. This at times causes delay and sometimes the quality of the hardcopy is not satisfactory for making copies. All these problems are easily solved when the system is made online. Also, it is easier to compile all the papers in a folder in a computer. The system works as follows: Each faculty is given an online account. Auto generated password would be sent to the official email address to ensure full proof confidentiality. The faculty chooses the subject for which s/he wants to submit the question paper and upload it in .pdf or .doc format. The COE and that faculty member receive a notification confirming the submission of the paper. The students project management system was mainly catering to the B.Tech program. M.Tech needed phase wise submission and evaluation system that was not there till now. It has been made operative now. Similarly, MSc IT program was not served much by this system but now it is updated to include these students too. 72 The students service portal is designed to improve the service delivery for the students. Students had to come physically to apply for a duplicate identity card or a transcript. Now the students can apply for these things from anywhere. The progress of the service also can be checked online. The portal is under construction at present. Evidence of success: Both the systems are working well and have reduced the manual work for the staff as well as faculty members. The need to go to each faculty member to collect the hard copy of the paper is gone. Filing of the papers has also become very easy due to this system. The students project management would greatly help in enhancing the accessibility of student reports, check for plagiarism and systematic listing of all details of the student projects. Details of all the reports would be readily available for each batch. It would make it easier to look for previous years reports for the MTech and MSc students. Title of the Practice: DAIICT Centre for Entrepreneurship & Incubation Objective: To encourage the faculty and students of DAIICT to work on innovative projects which could lead to productisation and commercial viability. Context: The Government of India has launched Make in India, Digital India, Start-Up India schemes to encourage growth in various areas. For a University, the start-up schemes are of great relevance as many ideas germinate in the academic atmosphere. The incubation centre has been formulated to encourage such activities in the Institute and an attempt is made to reach out to faculty and students of other institutes too to take advantage of this scheme. The practice: The faculty can start a company by himself/herself or s/ he can develop a product that can be sold commercially (Israel model of innovation). The Centre evaluates the 73 proposals. It helps the faculty member to collaborate and negotiate with industrial partners. It gives guidance regarding how to get a license for the technology generated. It particularly encourages start-ups. One of our faculty members has already started a company namely Corigby Private Limited. This company is developing a product which takes the idea of the user and connects him/her with different related resources on the web. The website acts like a guide that would help the idea generator to make the innovation reach a level where it could be meaningfully used. Till now, 10 companies have been generated from the funding of the incubation centre. Recently the Centre also organized a p atent awareness workshop to enhance entrepreneurship skills among students. Evidence of success Nine student initiatives and one faculty start-up have already been launched with the funding from this incubation centre. The Department of Science and Technology, DeitY, Industries Commissionerate, Govt. of Gujarat and Entrepreneur Development Institute are our partners in this initiative. Title of the Practice: TEdx DAIICT Objectives: 1. To invite leading local/regional thinkers and doers to speak 2. To make these talks available free online so that the knowledge and experience can spread world wide Context: TED is a world renowned organization that spreads good ideas through its talks. Most inspiring world leaders have appeared on TED talks. TED conferences are organized every year in Vancouver, Canada. To make this experiment even more inclusive, TED gives licence to local partners for independently organizing events, TEDx. The rules and regulations are given by TED, together with its name. The activities of the local 74 partner is monitored closely by them. However, the funding has to be organized by the local group itself. TEDx DAIICT is the student run chapter of the TED. TEDx Team The practice: The first edition of TEDx DAIICT was organized on 21 February, 2016. In the spirit of TEDx, we invited the local leaders who are making a change in people's lives by their inspiring work. The speakers for the first edition of TEDx were as follows: 1. Himanshu Patel: Himanshu Patel is the Sarpanch of Punsari  a village that has been declared a model village by both the state and the central government. Unlike other villages, this entire village is WiFi enabled and has street lights and a proper drainage system. In his talk Mr. Patel will talk about the dividends that come out when investments are made into villages. 2. Dr. Alka Parikh: A speaker who needs no introduction to any of us. Alka ma'am is loved for her energy and dynamism. A part of academia for 16 years now, she has also taken up issues for 75 research that feed into current debates the poor's perspective, and stories from the grass root. Her TEDx DAIICT talk will be based on her indulgences with food security and poverty. 3. Dr. Manisha Shah: Known as the "mother of football", Dr. Shah initiated Kahaani, a sports academy in Ahmedabad to nurture the idea of better health and an understanding of the importance of sports in our daily lives. She will be speaking about her journey with Kahaani and how it has impacted the lives of thousands of kids. 4. Jazz Sethi: Jazz Sethi is a professional choreographer and performer from Ahmedabad. Along with dance, she founded HEAL, a non-profit initiative which works with children suffering from cancer or any other disease. The broad aspects of her talk would be her insights from the various challenges she had faced. 5. Kristin Kagetsu: Kristin Kagetsu is the co-founder and chief executive officer of Saathi, a s ocial enterprise dedicated to providing eco-friendly sanitary pads to women everywhere. She is currently an MIT DLabScaleUps Fellow and one of the Asia21 Young Leaders. Her main focus will be on her idea of pioneering a way forward as an agent of change. 76 6. Nitin Tailor: Nitin Tailor founded the Serve Happiness Foundation where they organize youth inspirational programs and journeys to not only unravel the ethereal beauty of your country but importantly imbibe and spread the cultural values and the ensuing happiness onto our persona and the world at large. His talk will encapsulate the discoveries and learning from the Yatra. Evidence of success: The event was very much appreciated by all the stakeholders and TEDx has already approved a second edition for TEDx DAIICT. The speaker line up is being built up at present and the some funding has already been arranged for. Problems encountered and resources required: The problems are two fold: One, to raise funding resources. Two, to identify the local leaders who can qualify to become TEDx speakers. The quality of the speakers is of paramount importance for the success of the program and for retaining the licence from TED. 77 78 Statement of Compliance 79 DECLARATION 80 Appendix  1 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 Appendix  2 95 96 97 98 Appendix  3 99 100 101 102 Appendix - 4 103 104 105 106 107 108 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 Appendix - 5 119 120 Board of Governors Name Address President Shri Anil D.
