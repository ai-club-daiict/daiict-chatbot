2015 8 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Preface Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar was founded by the great pioneer, industrialist, and wealth creator, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani in 2001 with a vision To help build a knowledge-led society founded on intellectual competitiveness for global leadership. An act of the Gujarat Legislature provided for the establishment of the DA-IICT and conferred on it the status of a university in 2003. It was subsequently included in the list of universities maintained by the University Grants Commission under Section 2(f), and became a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) in 2009. The Institute is managed by a Board of Governors, Academic Council and Finance Committee with visionaries and leaders from the industry and academia as its members. DA-IICT is spread over 50 acres of land in the city of Gandhinagar, 80% of the land is open space reserved for green cover and garden, making it an environmentally friendly campus. The campus houses approximately 1500 students. Since its inception, DA-IICT has offered B.Tech, M.Tech, and PhD programmes in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). ICT was a unique discipline at that time and this move has since been emulated by a number of premier institutes across India. Over time, the Institute has expanded its offerings to include programmes in MSc(IT), MDes, and MSc(ICT in Agriculture and Rural Development). DA-IICT was envisioned to be a leader in higher learning and research in ICT domain. To support this, right from the beginning, Institute has searched for the best faculty members with a PhD from the best institutions across the world. Even with these stringent standards, we are still able to maintain a student-faculty ratio of 10:1 and are constantly on a lookout for quality faculty through a web-based continuous recruitment process. The curricula of all programmes are developed, updated and reviewed by a curriculum committee. The curriculum committee comprises of faculty members and experts from industry, research organizations, peer institutions, and alumni. Development or review of any programme at DA-IICT is a multi-stage rigorous process that includes the steps of Feasibility Study, Internal and External Feedback Study, Model Curricula Design and Requirement and Benchmark Study, finally leading to Formal Evaluation and NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 9 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Ratification by the Academic Council. In keeping with our vision of creating innovative programmes, we started a BTech level minor in computational science to cater to the emerging research areas of bio-computing, computational physics etc. DA-IICT has installed a comprehensive academic management system E-campus for transparent real- time access to all the relevant academic information for students. This, along with other online resources, including a very large library, journal database, course management portal, and a range of other integrated services make DA-IICT a truly smart campus. The Institute has a full range of research infrastructure and facilities, such as well- equipped laboratories, specialized equipments, campus-wide networking, and high-speed Internet access, and subscription to hundreds of print and online journals. The Institute has dedicated research laboratories two such examples would be the Information Retrieval Laboratory (http://irlab.daiict.ac.in/), and the Speech Processing Laboratory (https://sites.google.com/site/speechlabdaiict/). It also has an Incubation Center to nurture and develop business ideas based on new technology. To promote research in ICT, the Institute has chosen to have a single multidisciplinary faculty body, instead of one divided into separate departments. Most of the programmes and specializations have been consciously designed to promote interdisciplinary work. At the invitation of the Government of Gujarat, DA-IICT is mentoring the new Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara (IIIT-V) set up under Public-Private Partnership mode, which started admitting students from the academic year 2013-14. We are honoured to be the first private university in India to be entrusted the prestigious task of mentoring a premier central institute like IIIT-V. Over the years, our students have graduated and made a name for themselves in technical, managerial, and business domains. In keeping with the ethos of DA-IICT, a significant number of our students have setup successful startup enterprises. Our placement record is at par with the leading engineering institutes in India. In the short span of 14 years, DA-IICT has become a name synonymous with quality education and research in ICT domain and we are committed to provide the leadership role through constant innovation in programmes, curriculum, and pedagogy. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 10 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Executive Summary Criterion -I DA-IICT is a university devoted to Information and Communication (ICT) education and research. The ICT embodies the convergence of computer and communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. Criterion II This section describes the curriculum structure of DA-IICTs academic programmes. The curriculum of undergraduate and postgraduate programmes co-opts the pedagogical diversity of ICT education and research. Faculty of DA-IICT use innovative teaching- learning methodologies to make the students technically sound and enable them to serve the society with their knowledge and skills. Criterion III This section focuses on the pro-active steps taken by DA-IICT towards supporting the research activities of faculty and students. This includes seed support fund for new faculty and conference support fund for faculty and students. The office of Dean (R&D) has been created to help faculty seek external funding in support of research activities. The Institute has organized and hosted several workshops and conferences, encompassing a wide diversity of research areas. To support the research activities, the Institute subscribes to all major e-resources including IEL, Springer online, and ACM digital library. To promote innovation, the Institute has established an entrepreneurship center recognized by DeitY, which has launched several start-ups founded by students. With their wide-ranging research expertise, our faculty members have carried out several externally funded sponsored projects in collaboration with reputed national and international Institutes. The faculty members have received notable awards such as the Padma Shree and Dr. Vikram Sarabhai Award. The Institute has liaisons with R&D and defense agencies such as SAC-ISRO, Indian Navy, and TCS Innovation Labs. The faculty members and students are engaged in several activities to reach out to the larger society. This includes tribal development in the Andaman Islands and a student-led initiative called Sambhav which is dedicated to community service. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 11 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Criterion IV DA-IICT is the pioneer university that offered engineering education in the area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at the Undergraduate level. The Institute has, since its very inception, realised the importance of state-of-the-art infrastructure and learning resources in achieving its objective of being a world class research-led university. The green campus at DA-IICT provides the ideal environment for the students and faculty to engage in their pursuit of knowledge and research in the area of Information and Communication Technology and allied areas. The ICT infrastructure, the resources available at the Resource Centre, the residential facilities on campus for the students, food court and infrastructure for student activities provide the students with ample opportunities to enhance their learning experience beyond the four walls of the class room and the lab. These facilities go a long way in helping the students develop a well- rounded personality in addition developing their technical acumen in ICT areas. The infrastructural facilities are optimally used and periodically maintained to ensure that the best learning experience for the entire DA-IICT community. This section will highlight the initiatives taken at DA-IICT to ensure the same. Criterion V This criterion emphasizes on student life at DA-IICT, student activities, mentoring, support, progress and placement. DA-IICT is unique because of its small student-faculty community. This allows great accessibility and interaction, which we prize. We take a deep interest in our students and we take pride in their achievements, both while they are here and in the years and decades to come. DA-IICT is dedicated to its traditions of building a brighter, more successful future for its students. We provide a high quality experience that not only complements, but also enhances the learning that takes place in classrooms. Our mission is to engage and support the students throughout their learning experience. We promote and facilitate this growth through various extra-curricular activities. We oversee and coordinate the campus residence life, cafeteria services, student health, Student Body Government (SBG), sports and cultural activities, student clubs, the student e-magazine, counseling and many other NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 12 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology areas of student life. The students find a number of ways to socialize and make life-long friends, and create a cohesive community beyond racial, ethnic, gender and religious barriers. The extent to which the students take advantage of the academic, extra- curricular and social opportunities available here depends, in large measure, on their own initiative. Criterion VI In this section, detailing of Governance and the leadership of the Institute is brought comprehensively. This section also illustrates the delegation of authority across various governing bodies like Board of Governors, Academic Council, Board of Studies, Finance Committee, IQAC etc., The organizational structure of the Institute is also included which captures the role and the responsibilities of each stake holder. Criterion VII Criterion VII primarily addresses three chapter namely environment, innovation and best practices. Environment chapter discusses the practices that have been under taken for vermin composting and sewage treatment plan. Innovation chapter elaborates on the projects undertaken in the Institute and has social relevance. Chapter on best practices discusses the practices like rural internship and campus placement which has facilitated academic and administrative progress in the Institute. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 13 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology DA-IICT SWOC REPORT DA-IICT was established in 2001. Subsequently, it became a university under the State Act of Gujarat in 2003. It was granted recognition under section 2(f) of UGC and also the membership of Association of Indian Universities (AIU). DA-IICT is a unique institution established exclusively for imparting education in Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Information Technology Act of India itself was enacted in 2000. Establishment of an ICT University in 2001 shows the forward thinking of the Founder, Late Shri Dhirubhai Ambani. A state of the art infrastructure, scholarly faculty and autonomy in management gave DA-IICT a dream beginning and within a short span of its existence DA-IICT was recognized as one of the top institutions of Higher Education in India and abroad. Now after 15 years since inception, the top management of the institute decided to undergo a process of self-evaluation. As an outcome of this self-evaluation, it was decided upon to prepare a strategic plan which will guide the Institutes activities for the next 5 years. Director constituted a committee of Deans and senior professors to deliberate upon this issue and submit a report at the earliest. This committee of Deans and senior professors decided to conduct a SWOC (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Challenges) analysis of the Institute as a precursor of preparing the Strategic Plan. The main purpose of this exercise was to complement the strategic plan activities and to help in establishing strategic objectives. The committee had a series of interactions and brain storming sessions with all the stake holders which included, faculty, exit interviews of graduating students, employers, parents, peer institutions, surveys and rankings, etc. A balanced approach has been adopted so that the views of all constituencies are included. The assessment of strengths and weaknesses are facilitated through surveys, focus groups, anecdotal evidences provided by individual faculty and administrators. It is recognized that different perceptions may exist depending upon the representative group considered. Therefore considerable effort has been put in to reconfirm the identified SWOCs. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 14 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology A detailed SWOC analysis is presented below: STRENGTHS: 1. AUTONOMY IN GOVERNANCE: DA-IICT is established by the Reliance Group as a CSR initiative. It is a registered Society under the Bombay Public Trusts Act. It is a university under the State Act of the state of Gujarat. The Board of Governors, of which the Institutes Director is a member, gives broad guidelines towards managing the Institute. However the functional autonomy rests with the Director and his team. The delegation of authority and functional responsibilities are well documented leading to seamless governance of the Institute. 2. FACULTY PROFILE AND COMPOSITION: The minimum eligibility qualification prescribed for a faculty position at DA- IICT is a PhD. The cadre ratio is well structured with sufficient number of senior, middle level and young dynamic Professors, Associate Professors and Assistant Professors. Owing to the multidisciplinary nature of programmes offered, the composition of faculty is also quite multifaceted. Faculty at DA-IICT is drawn out of people graduating from premier universities in India and abroad. 3. RESEARCH DRIVEN TEACHING, LEARNING AND PEDAGOGY: Faculty at DA-IICT is self-motivated individuals inclined heavily towards pursuing their own research. Institute supports such endeavours of faculty by devising proactive measures in nurturing their aspirations. This research culture has reflected heavily on the teaching, learning and novel pedagogical methods adopted in day to day classroom lecture delivery and creating a positive impact on the student progression. Owing to this, our students are not only confident and skilled but also are compassionate human beings. 4. PHYSICAL AND ICT INFRASTRUCTURE: DA-IICT is an eco-friendly residential Institute. Out of the 50 Acres of land under the possession of the Institute, only 8 Acres is utilized for construction of buildings and physical infrastructure. The balance 40+ acres is maintained as NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 15 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology forest and horticultural plantations. Our entire academic infrastructure is ICT enabled. The laboratories are state of the art. A large portion of the budget is spent annually towards upkeep and augmentation of this infrastructure. Licensed softwares are made available to students stressing upon instilling the ethical values and inhibiting the use of pirated softwares. Subscription to large data bases, e-resources and repositories is another value addition. All stake holders make the best use of the available facilities. 5. HIGH CALIBRE STUDENT BODY AND OUTSTANDING ALUMNI: The competency level of students seeking admissions into DA-IICT is very high. Best students get admitted into DA-IICT under any category. Therefore nurturing student aspirations and moulding them into well rounded professionals is the task very well accomplished by the DA-IICT community. It is therefore quite obvious that the alumni of DA-IICT are outstanding. Performance of DA-IICT alumni in any professional role is well recognized, recorded and appreciated. WEAKNESS: 1. COLLABORATIVE INTER DISCIPLINARY RESEARCH: DA-IICT has a large strength of high quality researchers as its faculty. We are yet to harness this huge potential of collaborative and inter disciplinary research to the fullest capacity. There is enormous scope and opportunity for such a possibility. This would definitely lead to providing additional opportunities to our UG and PG scholars. 2. CONSULTANCY, PATENTS AND IPR: One reason for consultancy not taking off at expected levels may be the fledgling ICT industry in Gujarat. Nevertheless with opening up of markets and boost to industrial growth, there is ample scope to overcome this weakness. Also efforts towards creation of awareness about patenting and safe guarding the intellectual property rights have been made by organizing Patent-IPR workshops and Patent Clinics. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 16 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3. INTERNATIONAL ACADEMIC COLLABORATIONS: There have been some efforts in the past to go big on international collaborations, but has not yielded expected results. Some of the MoUs signed have not been operational and also not utilized to the fullest scope as envisaged. This would have led to diminished opportunities for stake holders. 4. FACULTY RESIDENCY: BTech(ICT), the flagship programme offered by the Institute is a residential programme. However the concept of residency may not have been utilized to the fullest potential due to non-availability of faculty quarters on campus. This may be attributed to the fact that ample, reasonably priced residence alternatives were always available to the faculty outside the campus. 5. EVERCHANGING GOVERNMENT POLICY ON ADMISSIONS: Government of Gujarat promulgated the Gujarat Professional Technical Educational Colleges or Institutions (Regulation of Admission and Fixation of Fees) Act, 2007 and brought in subsequent amendments in regulating the admissions to professional courses. This Act has taken away the autonomy of the Higher Educational Institutes in determining and administering their admission policies. This has led to delay in starting of the academic year and adherence to the academic calendar. OPPORTUNITIES: 1. INDUSTRY INSTITUTE INTERFACE AND EXTERNAL LINKAGES: DA-IICT has signed a couple of MoUs with reputed industries and academic institutions aiming towards providing additional opportunities for its stakeholders. There is ample scope for enhancements of such MoUs further, so as to open additional avenues for internships, joint research, exchange and consultancy. 2. INTERDISCIPLINARY PROGRAMMES: Owing to the nature of programmes offered, there is a great potential which can be harnessed in starting of new inter-disciplinary UG/PG programmes. One such NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 17 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology initiative has already fructified in the form of offering BTech(ICT) honors degree course with a minor in Computational Science. Many more such programmes may be added in days to come. 3. CREATING CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE: Availability of faculty with strong multifaceted research background opens up another major opportunity towards creation of Centers of Excellence. This can be achieved in collaboration with various funding bodies, agencies and industries. 4. STRENGTHENING ENTREPRENEURSHIP INTITATIVES: DA-IICT Centre for Entrepreneurship and Incubation (DCEI) has been set up with a vision of nurturing the dreams of budding entrepreneurs. Seed money and initial startup grants are made available to these young talents. However there is a major scope of further enhancing the activities of DCEI in the form of encouraging Faculty Entrepreneurship initiatives. 5. PROVIDING LEADERSHIP FOR THE GROWTH OF ICT EDUCATION: DA-IICT is unique in terms of the programmes it offers. The concept of inclusion of humanities and social sciences as a part of its curriculum was implemented successfully about more than a decade ago and the same has been prescribed by the policy makers of the higher education of late. This creates a great opportunity for us to be front runners in laying out an innovative path for other institutions of higher order learning. CHALLENGES: 1. FACULTY RETENTION: Mushrooming of institutions has led to poaching of faculty from one institute to the other. This has thrown open a major challenge in retention of qualified faculty. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 18 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2. SELF RELIANCE IN FINANCES: This is a major challenge. With the mandate of the management to make quality education affordable, self-sustenance becomes really difficult. Avenues towards generating and augmenting internal revenues must be further explored. 3. SUSTENANCE AS PREMIER INSTITUTE: During the brief period of its existence, DA-IICT has emerged as one of the premiere Institute imparting Higher Education in this country. Of late, with Government taking control over the admission process and also authority to determine the fees, the institute has lost autonomy in two major areas. This has opened up further challenges in safe guarding Institutes interest and sustenance as a premiere institute. 4. DEARTH OF SCHOLARSHIP: As per UGC report India has about 700 degree awarding universities. Also introduction of Rashtriya Uchathar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA), starting of new universities and institutes of higher education, there is an acute shortage of qualified faculty throughout the country. It is even more difficult to get people in the niche technology area which DA-IICT needs. This is indeed a real challenge. 5. FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES IN INDIA: With the opening up of economy and liberalization, Government of India has introduced Foreign Education Providers Bill, 2013 in the Lok sabha. The bill is yet to be ratified by the Parliament. Once ratified, this will create a gateway for Foreign Universities to set up their operations here and which would definitely throw up another challenge to Indian universities. A detailed SWOC Analysis is presented. Efforts to capture the feedback and inputs from various stakeholders have resulted in obtaining a meaningful SWOC report. This analysis will effectively lead to, understanding the institutes strengths and opportunities and devising measures towards thwarting challenges and weaknesses. Also, even though any strategic plan is built as a long term document, it must have inherent flexibility in terms of making adaptations and adjustments depending on changing ground realities NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 19 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology from time to time. Also continuous assessments must be conducted annually so as to fine tune the implementation of the strategic plan.

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 29 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology CRITERION I: CURRICULAR ASPECTS DA-IICT is a university devoted to information and communication technology (ICT) education and research. The ICT embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. DA- IICT also sees itself as a civic institution deeply committed to seeing its students as responsible citizens. Its humanities and social science courses, its variety of internships are designed to increase social commitment and competence as citizens understanding the nature of societal and organizational needs. The course structure of the curricula is broadly classified into 3 categories. The first category, referred to as Foundation, is a set of compulsory courses required to be taken by every student in the programme. The next one is formed by a set of courses, referred to as the Electives, which forms both the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the programmes. The third one is composed of internships and projects. The curricula provide students a multi-track option where a student can achieve depth in one track and/or breadth in multiple tracks through an appropriate choice of elective courses. As technology makes impact on the pedagogical issues, the structure of our curricula provides enough rooms to accommodate new technologies and knowledge by offering new electives in emerging areas. The pedagogy of ICT should make a well-integration of information technology, electronics and communications engineering and social sciences courses, which a student cannot be trained in conventional computer science & engineering or electronics and communication engineering alone. The curriculum of UG and PG programmes adapts the pedagogical issues of ICT education and research. All our faculty are PhDs and they use innovative teaching-learning methodologies to make the students technically sound and self-reliant knowledge pool who are ready to serve the society with their knowledge and skills. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 30 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 1.1 Curriculum Design and Development DA-IICT is committed towards academic integrity, transparent evaluation and quality education. The institute offers BTech and MTech programmes in information and communication technology (ICT), a unique discipline for undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) programmes introduced by the institute in 2001, which was the first in the country. To begin with, this was an intellectual experiment combining the twin segments of information and communication into a unified system called information and communication technology (ICT). This fundamental innovation combining the computer science & engineering and electronics & communications engineering was embedded in a large matrix of inter-disciplinary subjects including film, animation, design, science studies and management along with the traditional humanities and social sciences course. The discipline aims to create trained student as a professional and as a citizen dealing with knowledge systems at large but with a core competence in ICT. The flagship programme of the Institute is its BTech (ICT) programme, which can be visualized as a unique combination of the following three core domains: - Information Technology - Communication Technology - Electronics Engineering These three domains constitute the hybridity of ICT as an innovative knowledge system at the undergraduate level of engineering. To the inter-disciplinary of the engineering domain the undergraduate course adds innovative strands from Humanities and Social Sciences. The Institute continually puts efforts in bringing important humanities and social science courses, namely, cultural studies, film studies, Gandhian studies, art and science fiction into its curriculum. To this layer of social science inter-disciplinary, it added a second layer of management, finance, economics and environment studies. The third interdisciplinary grid centres on animation, film, design, graphic design and multimedia systems. It is this four-fold inter-disciplinary that makes the undergraduate BTech (ICT) programme of DA-IICT a truly innovative systemic venture. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 31 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology The Institute has also introduced a new UG programme in computational science as minor for BTech honours in ICT in 2013. In addition to regular BTech(ICT) programme, the BTech(ICT) honours programme adds few courses, both core and electives, in computational science specialization. The MTech(ICT) primarily focuses on research-led curriculum that allows students to study in a specialization based on students choice. The specializations offer in MTech (ICT) programmes are computer networks, algorithmics, communication systems, machine intelligence, signal processing, and VLSI and embedded systems. The Institute also offers MSc (Information Technology), MSc (ICT and Agriculture and Rural Development), MDes (Communication Design), and doctoral programs in ICT areas. The curricula of all programmes are developed, updated and reviewed by the curriculum committee constituted by the Institute. The curriculum committee is typically chaired by a senior faculty of the Institute, and is comprised of experts from industry, research organizations, and academia. The curriculum committee follows the standard guidelines (e.g., ACM Computing curricula) while devising a new and/or revising an existing curriculum for a programme. The local, national and global needs are always kept in view while developing the curriculum of a programme.

If yes, give details of the process (need assessment, feedback, etc.). Yes. The curricula of UG and PG programmes of the Institute impart breadth and depth of knowledge, skills and values that students can learn through the programme to serve the society. The Institute follows a systematic process in devising and reviewing the curricula of its various programmes. The curriculum development of a particular programme went through several rounds of brainstorming discussions in the committee and with peers, keeping in view industrial and research needs, as well as the rapid development of the ICT in industry. The Institute has constituted Board of Studies comprising faculty, alumni and industry experts, who looks after all matters relating to curriculum development. The Institute designed its curriculum for its UG and PG programmes in 2001, and later on reviewed it twice based on the feedback received from the students, alumni, industry and peers. One mid-term brain storming about the curricula took place in 2003 with an expert group consisting of internal faculty and accomplished people from IITs and industry. The following steps are being followed for new curriculum designing or reviewing an existing one.  The Institute has adopted a mechanism to review the curriculum of UG programme once in every 5 years, and the curriculum of PG programme once in every 3 years. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 42 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology  Curriculum development and revision for all programs goes through a process that begins with the constitution of a curriculum committee headed by a senior faculty under the guidance of Board of Studies.  Any new curriculum design committee consists of internal faculty, domain experts, external experts from academia and industry.  The committee discusses and comes out with a draft curriculum which is then discussed in the larger forum of faculty body.  On a notional approval from the faculty body the final draft of the curriculum or the revision is again subjected to a brain storming process in the presence of experts from the academia and industry.  The final draft curriculum or suggested revision is then put up to Board of Studies, which then forwards, with necessary recommendations, the draft to Academic Council of the Institute for final approval.  Once the Academic Council approves the curriculum, it goes for implementation in the academic programme. Curriculum Review Committee Deliberation In our BTech and MTech programmes, the curriculum has a good degree of flexibility in terms of electives, internships, and projects. For each course, the pre- requisite course(s) and learning objectives are clearly stated based on which the instruction plan and assessment plan are also well-defined for most of the courses. Course-wise feedback is taken from students at least once in a semester. In some courses, the instructor takes course feedback multiple times, namely, at the beginning of the course, mid-semester feedback, and end-semester feedback. The NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 43 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology students feedback is taken into account for the subsequent updating/upgrading the course content, delivery mechanism, and for the course allocation in subsequent academic sessions. The process followed in the curriculum induction or revision in our programme is depicted below: Curriculum Review Process Programme Educational Objectives & Programme Outcomes Faculty input Industry input Vision, Mission of the Institute Stakeholders Feedback Curriculum Committee Draft Curriculum Faculty Body Board of Studies Academic Council Approved Curriculum Suggestions and Modifications NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 44 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 1.1.3 How are the following aspects ensured through curriculum design and development? Employability: The curriculum design and development defined by PEO and PO is mainly guided with respect to ensuring the opportunities and employability of our graduates. Furthermore, industrial internships, rural internship, industry oriented projects, case studies, and electives included in the curriculum enable the employability of the students. The lab component of various courses facilitates the development of practical skills based on the use well-equipped labs which provides students in gaining unique exposure and making them right candidates for employment. The Placement and Training Cell of the Institute also conducts many soft skill training and mock tests for the students to improve the skill sets required by the Industry. The feedback collected from employers is used for enhancing the curriculum by adding electives and improving course delivery. Innovation: The students at both UG and PG programmes are provided numerous opportunities for innovation via internships, course projects, semester projects, independent study courses, online courses and through sponsored research projects. Research: Since the faculty members are active researchers, they involve students in their research projects as project trainees or associates. Undergraduate students can participate in research through the option of research internships or BTech project, which can foster students research potential in an ongoing manner at an individual or group level. The internships / project works of the curriculum gives an opportunity for the students to carry out research based projects, which may lead to publications in conferences/journals. The MTech students are required to work on a yearlong thesis. Many courses encourage students for research based term papers, which enable students participating as a team for research exploration on a given paper or topic. The PhD programme has attracted a good number of students who work in different areas of ICT discipline. The PhD students contribute enormously in various sponsored research projects and by presenting papers and participating in research forums at national and international levels. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 45 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 1.1.4 To what extent does the university use the guidelines of the regulatory bodies for developing and/or restructuring the curricula? Has the university been instrumental in leading any curricular reform which has created a national impact? The Institute uses the approaches adopted by other national level institutions such as IITs for developing its curricula. The Institute was the first in the country to offer degree programmes in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) at UG and PG levels. In recent past, some other institutions have also started offering similar programmes. Our alumni have now established the brand name of our Institute in the industry and other top universities in India and abroad. The curriculum of our UG programme is broadly divided into the following major components - Basic sciences, Humanities and social sciences, Core Engineering courses, Professional electives, Science electives and Open electives. The unique feature of the curriculum is that it incorporates the field of Science, Technology and Society studies as a core course component of the programme. The programme requires students to do two internships and a final project (either full semester or spread over to two semesters). The curriculum of the programme has also enough rooms for electives, technical communications, and specialization core courses. The students are required to do one year thesis work to complete their degree requirement. Considering the above facts into account, the Institute has successfully reformed the ICT curricular at UG and PG levels and its importance in todays digital transformation in our society. 1.1.5 Does the university interact with industry, research bodies and the civil society in the curriculum revision process? If so, how has the university benefitted through interactions with the stakeholders? Yes. The Board of Studies (BOS) of the Institute supervises the entire process of the curriculum revision. The BOS consists of Deans, UG and PG conveners, faculty representatives of all programmes, alumni, and external experts from academia and industry. Upon BOSs recommendation, the Director constitutes a NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 46 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology committee, comprising faculty coordinators of all programmes and external experts from academia and industry, for curriculum revision. During the curriculum revision or induction, external experts from industry, academia and civil society were invited to discuss the curriculum and designing the course contents. The alumni feedback and employers opinions are always taken into consideration while devising any curriculum. The Academic Council of the Institute is the main body for all academic matters, incorporation of changes in the curriculum of a programme. The Academic Council consists of experts from IITs, industry, and parent organizations representatives. The curriculum review committee incorporates recommendations made by all stakeholders in the revised curriculum and submits the same for approval to the Academic Council through BOS. 1.1.6 Give details of how the university facilitates the introduction of new programmes of studies in its affiliated colleges.

Name a few programmes and comment on their outcome. The BTech and MTech programmes in ICT are strongly inter-disciplinary. This is because of the innovative curriculum adopted for the ICT discipline that combines the Information Technology, Communication Technology and Electronics Engineering. The curriculum accommodates a large component of inter- disciplinary subjects including Film, Animation, Design, Science Studies and Management along with the traditional Humanities and Social Sciences. This flagship programme visualizes the student as a professional and as a citizen dealing with knowledge systems at large but with a core competence in ICT. The institute introduced courses in Science Studies, Cultural Studies, Film Studies, Gandhian Studies, Art and Science Fiction. The curriculum has also added a Management, Finance, Economics and Environment, and courses on Animation, Film, Design, Graphic Design and Multi-Media systems. Many of electives are open to both UG and PG programmes that opens up an innovative venture of knowledge sharing platform among undergraduate and postgraduate students. Other programmes MSc (IT), MSc(ICT-ARD) and MDes (Communication Design) are also indicative of our institutes intent to promote inter-disciplinary learning. Since the foundation, we have been of the opinion that engineers must be sensitized for design perspective and ergonomics. At the same time unless a designer understands limitations of technology, the product cannot see the dawn NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 62 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology of the market. The offering of MDes programme in our university is a message to that philosophy. These design programme students live and interact with the to- be-engineers of ICT and hence their perspective of communication design, be it entertainment, product, gaming etc., their approach towards seeking solution is certainly different. We refer to the section 1.2.2 which gives the details of curriculum of each programme, distribution of courses, flexibility of students choice, etc, which would give a clear picture of interdisciplinary nature of all the programmes. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 63 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 1.3 Curriculum Enrichment 1.3.1 How often is the curriculum of the university reviewed and upgraded for making it socially relevant and/or job oriented /knowledge intensive and meeting the emerging needs of students and other stakeholders?

Due to which the end result is a robust intensive course curriculum which has a long standing under changing academic scenarios. In addition to this rigorous process there is an everlasting flexibility to the faculty to regularly update the course contents, particularly for the elective courses, to keep pace with the latest technologies used in industry. The exit feedback and various stakeholders feedback taken into account to know the gaps/issues and accordingly appropriate mechanisms adopted to address the issues. The institute typically revises the UG programme curriculum in every 5 years, and PG programme in 3years timeframe. 1.3.2 During the last four years, how many new programmes at UG and PG levels were introduced? Give details. * Inter-disciplinary The following specializations have been added to the existing MTech(ICT) - MTech specialization in Signal Processing - MTech specialization in Algorithmics * Programmes in emerging areas - BTech(Honours in ICT) with minor in Computational Science 1.3.3 What are the strategies adopted for the revision of the existing programmes? What percentage of courses underwent a syllabus revision? Any revision of the curriculum or structure of the existing programmes requires discussion in the Board of Studies (BOS) constituted by the Institute. The BOS consists of senior faculty members from different programmes and external experts from industry and academic. For any need of curriculum revision, the BOS recommends the Director to constitute a curriculum review committee who NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 64 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology will discuss it further with the all stakeholders and then submits the revised curriculum formally to the Academic Council of the Institute. The Academic Council consists of academicians from IITs and experts from Industry and R&D organization. The Academic Council discusses all matters relating to the academic programmes, and suggests appropriate measures for academic growth of the institute. Upon receiving the proposed revised curriculum, the Academic Council may approve the proposed revision suggested by the curriculum review committee or may suggest for incorporation of any changes in it, after discussing the merits of the proposal. The Institute follows the UG programmes curriculum review once in 5 years, and for the PG programs the cycle is once in 3 years. New elective courses are introduced regularly after the approval of the Dean (AP). The proposer of a new course is required to submit his/her course plan to Dean(AP).Then, the UG committee/PG committee conducts the review process of the course proposal with the help of internal and external faculty/experts. The new course proposal gets reviewed by at least two reviewers, and after that, the review comments are forwarded to the course proposer for their incorporation in the course proposal. Once the proposer incorporates it in the new course, the course proposal gets approval of the UG/PG/Dean(AP). The Institute has a standing IQAC committee which also supervises the activities related to the academic matters for assuring the quality education. [Annexure 1.8: The members of Board of Studies and Academic Council] 1.3.4 What are the value-added courses offered by the university and how does the university ensure that all students have access to them?

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 75 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.1.8 Were any programmes discontinued/ staggered by the university in the last four years? If yes, please specify the reasons. No, the Institute has not discontinued any programme in the last four years. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 76 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.2 Catering to Student Diversity 2.2.1 Does the university organize orientation / induction programme for freshers? If yes, give details such as the duration, issues covered, experts involved and mechanism for using the feedback in subsequent years. Yes, the Institute organizes separate orientation programmes for UG and PG students. The UG orientation programme is spread over 3 days long schedule and the PG orientation programme is a week-long schedule. The orientation schedule covers the programme objectives, outcomes, curriculum, course/credit structures, course registration system, academic rules and regulations, resource centre, lab visits, and life on campus. The UG and PG committees coordinate the entire orientation schedule for the respective programmes. The schedule includes the welcome address by the Director, PEO and PO by Dean(AP), research & development by Dean(R&D), campus life by Dean(Students), administrative information by Registrar, and discussions other faculty, staff and peer students. [Annexure 2.2: Orientation programmes] 2.2.2 Does the university have a mechanism through which the differential requirements of the student population are analysed after admission and before the commencement of classes? If so, how are the key issues identified and addressed? At the beginning of the academic session, newly admitted students come to the Institute from various backgrounds across the country. In order to make the new students comfortable in the campus, the orientation programme helps them in familiarizing with classrooms, laboratories, administration, co-curricular activities, and the academic guidelines. In the orientation schedule, senior students conduct sessions for freshers on different activities held in the campus where students can participate and contribute. In addition, the Institute has anti- raging cell and gender cell, mentored by faculty, which can address proactively any issue raised by any student. A professional counsellor and faculty mentors are also available in the campus, which can make new students acquainted with the campus. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 77 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.2.3 Does the university offer bridge / remedial / add-on courses? If yes, how are they structured into the time table? Give details of the courses offered, department-wise/faculty-wise? Yes, remedial classes (Study Hours) are offered in every semester for the students who are put on academic probation. The remedial sessions are also supported by teaching assistants. Typically, evening hours are preferred to conduct the remedial sessions. The instructor plans for the remedial sessions for his/her course and implement the same as and when the demand arises. Students in the remedial sessions come with the problems or the gap that they have in a particular course and they solve the problems or make-up the gap with the help of teaching assistants supervised by the course instructor. In addition, a good number of remedial courses are offered in the summer semester in which a student can clear any backlog course and opt for course improvement as per the academic guidelines. Following are the list of courses that are typically open for remedial courses: - Digital Logic Design - Introduction to Programming - Analog and Digital Communications - Data Structures - Communication Skills - Calculus and Complex Variables - Introduction to Discrete Mathematics - Analog Circuits - Computer Organization - Signals and Systems 2.2.4 Has the university conducted any study on the academic growth of students from disadvantaged sections of society, economically disadvantaged, physically handicapped, slow learners, etc.? If yes, what are the main findings? The Institute is attentive of the candidates belonging to disadvantaged sections of society, economically disadvantaged, physically handicapped, slow learners, etc. To help these students the Institute provides full tuition fee waivers to NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 78 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology economically disadvantaged students depending on their family income and merits. The Institute provides reservations for physically handicapped, SC, ST and OBC in admissions. It has been observed that slow learners need special care and attention. The Institute provides mentoring and counselling to weaker students. Special classes are conducted for slow learners and weak students beyond the class/lab hours. Furthermore, summer semester provides opportunity to weaker students to makeup the backlog courses and allows them to improve course performance. All these measures help students substantially who come from these sections. [Annexure 2.3: Study hours classes] 2.2.5 How does the university identify and respond to the learning needs of advanced learners? If a student has high Cumulative Performance Index (CPI), he/she would be considered as advanced learner. The Institute allows advanced learners to take extra courses, to enrol in higher level courses. With this such students would have the opportunity to enhance their knowledge to a great extent. The Institute also provides them an opportunity to help the course instructor in laboratory work or engaging them in Study hours. Through this, the advanced learners get opportunity to excel in teaching skills, and at the same time, they avail stipend. This experience is valuable since this helps students secure admissions in higher education. The Institute encourages advanced learners to take part in various live projects supervised by the faculty or by any other university or industry. Working in such projects enables students to enrich their knowledge. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 79 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.3 Teaching-Learning Process The teaching-learning and evaluation (TLE) process is carried out throughout the academic year. All the courses follow credit-based system. As a result, the teaching practice is structured into Theory-Tutorial-Practical (L-T-P). For example, a course with 3-0-2-4 indicates that the course will have weekly 3 hours of lectures and 2 hours of practical, and the student who has registered for this course will earn 4 credits (note: 2 hours of practical give 1 credit). In the classroom, the teaching aids involve white board, document projector, slides presentation, and discussion through group/assignment/project. All the instructors announce the grading policy of their courses in the first week of every semester. The grading policy is decided by the course instructor, and typically, the policy considers in giving weightage to in-semester exams, end semester exam, assignments, quizzes, labs, class participation, projects, etc. Continuous evaluation is practiced in all courses and students are provided needful advice in a timely manner. The salient features of institutes TLE process include:  Admissions-accountability, transparency and responding to the diverse needs in TLE process.  Merit scholarships and merit-cum-means scholarships for UG and PG programmes.  Course allocation based on peers opinion and students feedback.  Adherence to academic calendar for all academic activities.  Updating Resource centre and Labs infrastructure based on subjects needs.  Adopting strategies for slow and advanced learners.  Providing full-time counsellors and faculty mentors to students.  Encouraging students for research based projects, participation in competition at national and international levels. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 80 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.3.1 How does the university plan and organise the teaching, learning and evaluation schedules (academic calendar, teaching plan, evaluation blue print, etc.)? The academic calendar is prepared by the Registrar in consultation with the Dean (AP) and approved by the Academic Council prior to the academic year. The calendar outlines the semester schedule, examinations schedule, and course evaluation schedule. The course allocation to faculty for the year is prepared by the Dean (AP), with the input of faculty, UG and PG committees, and informed to students prior to the registration of a semester. [Annexure 2.4: Academic Calendar] Lecture, Lab and Tutorial Timetable is made available to students, faculty and staff well in advance before the commencement of a semester. The institute follows slots mechanism in the timetable which provides students flexibility in selecting courses from the slots. [Annexure 2.5: Academic Year Time Table] All courses follow credit based evaluation system, i.e., a course with credit structure 3-0-4-5 requires students to attend 3 hours lectures and 4 hours labs per week, and allows students to earn 5 credit points after successful completion of the course. The lecture plan for a particular course is conveyed to students by the course instructor before the course commences in a semester. The instructor prepares for the lesson plan stating topics to be covered including methodology and the evaluation process for the course. The performance of the students is assessed on a continuous basis by conducting in-semester exams, end-semester exam, assignments, quizzes, student presentations, and projects. A minimum of 80% attendance is required in each course for appearing for the end semester examination. After evaluation, the answer books are shown to the students so that they can see where they have made mistakes and discuss with the instructor accordingly. The semester result is announced within a week after the end semester examination. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 81 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.3.2 Does the university provide course outlines and course schedules prior to the commencement of the academic session? If yes, how is the effectiveness of the process ensured? Yes, the Institute provides the course outline and the course schedule to the students prior to the commencement of the academic session. This helps students in selecting electives and balancing their course load towards meeting the criteria of degree requirements. The instructor of a course provides lecture plan and course materials to students prior to the commencement of a semester. The calendar provides enough time to students for adjusting their courses registered for the semester. A student can change the courses that he/she registered for a semester by adding and dropping courses till the last date for add/drop as specified in the academic calendar. 2.3.3 Does the university face any challenges in completing the curriculum within the stipulated time frame and calendar? If yes, elaborate on the challenges encountered and the institutional measures to overcome these. The Institute does not face any challenges in completing the curriculum within the stipulated time frame and calendar. In other words, all our academic activities strictly adheres the academic calendar. One of the important advantages the Institute has that the campus is residential for students. Furthermore, the institute follows less holidays. With the above, the concerned committees put significant efforts for their tasks and take necessary steps to announce the timetable well in advance, labs preparation, examination, evaluation and result announcement with so meticulously that we do not face any challenges to meet the academic calendar to complete all academic activities in time.

Some faculty have experimented with flipped classroom methodology for teaching advanced technical electives with small enrolment levels. Wikipedia defines flipped classroom as an instructional strategy and a type of blended learning that reverses the traditional educational arrangement by delivering instructional content, often online, outside of the classroom and moves activities, including those that may have traditionally been considered homework, into the classroom We have found that by providing the study material, including lecture notes, online videos, and research papers for the students to study on their own before they come to class, the lectures can be turned into problem solving, ideation, and brain-storming sessions. This has resulted in an enhanced satisfaction level of the students for the course and a superior achievement of the learning outcomes. Another interesting mechanism used in some courses is the use of narratives. In some of the humanities and social sciences courses, concepts are taught through anecdotes and real life news rather than only theories. In other words, the pedagogical approach is that of storytelling. All concepts are taught by narrating stories or relating them with everyday incidences. The advantage is that, students remember the concepts for much longer time. In addition, to make learning student-centric, following are some teaching- learning mechanisms followed by the faculty of the Institute. 1. Instructors use effective course delivery mechanism for foundational courses  Core engineering, Mathematics and Basic Sciences. Typically, a standard textbook is recommended for core courses, and instructors use online course materials (e.g. courseara, MOOC) to update the contents of the courses. Each semester, a combination of Core engineering courses, Basic sciences, and Humanities and social sciences is placed in the curriculum, so that students can balance their load and understanding from these courses and do some projects work in subsequent semesters. 2. The curricula of UG and PG programmes provide enough space to students for selecting electives so that students can pursue research based projects or NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 84 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology specialize in a particular domain. In some of the elective courses, a student is allowed to follow his/ her questions and themes that they wish to explore within the broad rubric of the course. 3. Students perform a minimum of 2-3 laboratory courses per semester from 1stto7thsemester of BTech, and in the first two semesters of MTech and MSc (IT) programmes. All the laboratories are well-equipped with hardware, software and open source tools. Teaching Assistants (PhD and MTech students) help in all core courses including some electives which have tutorials or lab components. 4. To communicate effectively in second language to non-native English speakers in large classes at university level is a challenging task. The teachers role is dynamic and frequently evolving in the current scenario, from being someone who delivers direct instruction to being a guide who facilitates and ensures that students take ownership in the learning process and become effective learners. Rather than being bound by a single textbook, instructors use different selections from prose, poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and technical articles for class discussions, to stimulate the interest level of students. 5. Continuous assessment of each course is done throughout the semester. The instructor announces the assessment mechanism and grading policy prior to the commencement of classes. Typically, in-semester exams, end semester exam, quizzes, assignments, in-class participation are some of the measures that help in assessment of students performance. 6. Students actively participate in IEEE student branch and ACM student branch, and many students chapters established by the professional bodies at the institute. Students are also encouraged to participate and present technical papers at National/International Conferences organized in the institute and outside. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 85 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.3.5 What is the universitys policy on inviting experts / people of eminence to deliver lectures and/or organize seminars for students? The Institute has been quite active in inviting eminent educationists and researchers as adjunct faculty/ visiting faculty. The institute regularly conducts lectures, organizes symposia, seminars, and workshops. To motivate students and faculty, the institute invites experts regularly to deliver lectures in various research areas. This process enables faculty, students and institute as whole to sharing research experience, building association and reaching out the knowledge society in our country and abroad. [Annexure 2.6: Research Progression Policy] 2.3.6 Does the university formally encourage blended learning by using e-learning resources? Being the premier ICT institute in the country, the Institute is very proactive in incorporating the new techniques of e-learning resources in the academic practices. Our library has a rich collection of e-resources  National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) lectures materials under NMEICT, e-journals of all leading publishers, special lecture series on various ICT domains archived in DVD/CD, and communication language materials. Most of the laboratory courses use extensively open source tools and e-resources of other forms in the respective courses, based on the concerned course instructors course policy. The course content and lecture materials of all courses are posted on NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 86 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology respective facultys folder on institutes intranet. Many faculty use Moodle to manage their courses, such as assignments announcement, submissions, group discussions, sharing other reading materials etc. Faculty members use e-resources of textbooks, NPTEL resources, videos, applets, open source tools, and e-journals. While encouraging students for using e-resources, the institute inculcates the ethical practice amongst all users to acknowledge the sources of e-resources. Many of our students use e-books and enrol in online courses, e.g., MOOC, Coursera. Besides, students are also encouraged to participate in national/international level online contest such as programming ACM ICPC, Microsoft Imagine Cup, IBM TGMC, Google summer of code, etc, by which they get useful exposure and visualize on how one can make the effective use of e- resources from classroom learning to real-world practice. [Annexure 2.7: List of e-resources in the Resource Centre] 2.3.7 What are the technologies and facilities such as virtual laboratories, e- learning, open educational resources and mobile education used by the faculty for effective teaching? As stated in 2.3.6 about the various mechanisms that have been implemented for our academic programmes, our campus not only a Green campus by its physical look, but also a true Green campus both physically and logically. The institute manages student, teacher, employees records in its E-campus system. The E- campus student is accessible to students, faculty and staff for its various modules. Most of our academic activities function towards paper less philosophy, e.g. making effective use of e-campus, starting from students registration, grading, result announcement, project management, and management all employees data happen through the E-campus system. Library follows an open access system where users can walk in to library and NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 87 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology directly access resources. The Library operations are fully computerized and connected to campus network and the users can access all the online and digital resources. The infrastructure facilities include preview room of 65 seats for group viewing of audio visual materials, cubicles for faculty and researchers, 48 PCs with internet connectivity, Wi-Fi connectivity, network access to CDs and DVDs, digital resource access, TV viewing and listening to radio with wireless headphones, printers and photocopiers. 2.3.8 Is there any designated group among the faculty to monitor the trends and issues regarding developments in Open Source Community and integrate its benefits in the universitys educational processes? From the beginning the Institute had constituted a standing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) committee, comprising with faculty members and senior system personnel, who looks after all requirements of software and hardware related to courses. Any individual requirement needs to be submitted to the lab in-charge, who takes needful action and approval of the ICT committee for procurement or getting an open-source version of the requested component. Following are some open source tools that are being used in different courses: Open source OS Fedora (having in-built various packages, tools as well as software), Eagle 6.5.0--- light edition, Scilab, Miktex, LT Spice/swCAD III, Winrar, Acrobat reader, VLC player, open office, Turbo C, Pspice student version, Wireshark, Apache Tomcat, Eclipse, Eclipse with UML tool Object Aid, Jbuilder, Jcreator LE, Mozilla Firefox browser, Google chrome browser, MYSQL, Net beans, PG Admin III, PHP, Python, Shockwave player, SSH secure shell client, bloodshed devc++, LC3 simulator, Java with java doc, Arduino, QGIS, CMAP, Vensim, MicroImage TMT, Postgresql,, DIA, Silos, Crimson Editor, Logisim, Applian FLV Player, Clamwin Free Antivirus , AVR studio, Edit plus, GPL ghost script, KEIL Vision 4, OMNET++, StarUML, Winpcap, 8085 simulator, Magic VLSI layout, kchmviewer, phpDesigner, NS-2, and SUMO. The Institute has an elected (non-political) Student Body Government (SBG), which helps various units of the academic administration on students requirement, labs related issues, and course/timetable matter. The SGB regularly NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 88 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology conducts events on developments in open source tools, apps design, programming, cross platform development, debate, and so on. [Annexure 2.8: List of Active Students Club] 2.3.9 What steps has the university taken to orient traditional classrooms into 24x7 learning places? The Institute has high speed (1000 mbps) Internet connectivity. The campus is also WiFi enabled and students hostel rooms are connected with high speed Internet. All labs are equipped with modern computing infrastructure. The resource centre is open up to late in the night and even whole nights sometimes depending on the requirement. Students attend lectures and labs as per the timetable and takeaways assignments which they discuss with peers and instructor/TA and solve the problems anytime while staying in the hostel, the library or in the labs. As a result, the Institute has effectively transformed conventional classrooms into 24x7 learning mode. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 89 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.3.10 Is there a provision for the services of counsellors / mentors/ advisors for each class or group of students for academic, personal and psycho-social guidance? If yes, give details of the process and the number of students who have benefitted. The Institute has engaged the services of a professional counsellor, who is available in the campus two full days in a week. Many students avail the counselling services on issues related to personal, academic, and career concerns. This counselling remains confidential, so that student can freely express his/her concern as and when required. In addition, the Institute has adopted following measures for students counselling/mentoring/advising:  First year UG students are mentored group-wise by the UG committee.  Faculty mentorship is provided to weaker students in their problem areas.  Study Hour is mentored by the UG committee, which is made primarily for the students who are on academic probation.  Many courses, primarily for the lab classes, encourage students to do project or lab experiment in groups, which are supervised by the course instructor and teaching assistants.  Faculty is available for supervising student project work, training and internship. 2.3.11 Were any innovative teaching approaches/methods/practices adopted/put to use by the faculty during the last four years? If yes, did they improve learning? What were the methods used to evaluate the impact of such practices? What are the efforts made by the institution in giving the faculty due recognition for innovation in teaching? As mentioned in 2.3.4 the teaching-learning process followed are student-centric. The Institute strongly encourages faculty to use innovative teaching methods. The use of e-resources, open source tools, open courseware, online tools helps in course delivery. Many courses follow project-based learning, encourage group- wise lab experiments, adopt open book test, which are some methodologies that NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 90 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology faculty members have considered in the last four years, which have shown substantial improvement in teaching and delivery mechanisms in various courses. The Institute recognizes and rewards excellence in teaching through various methods including faculty career progression, appraisal based annual incentive/increment, sponsorship for visiting position, summer schools, conferences, workshop, etc. [Annexure 2.9: Innovative teaching-Learning Mechanisms] 2.3.12 How does the university create a culture of instilling and nurturing creativity and scientific temper among the learners In many courses, students are encouraged to come up with innovative solutions to existing problems of practical applications. Students are given expert guidance in their internships and BTPs, where they refer research papers and explore in related development tools.

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 101 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.5 Evaluation Process and Reforms 2.5.1 How does the university ensure that all the stakeholders are aware of the evaluation processes that are in place? Each instructor is responsible for the evaluation process for the course(s) taught by him/her. The instructor has to inform the students of the evaluation process of the course at the beginning of the semester. Dean (AP) and conveners of UG and PG committees oversee the evaluation process that is followed in courses in respective programs. In the beginning of the first semester, students are required to attend an orientation programme, where academic guidelines and evaluation process are explained in detail to the students as well as to the parents. In addition, student body keeps continuously in touch with Dean (AP), UG and PG committees conveners for clarifying any doubts concerning the evaluation process, credit requirements, results, or grades. 2.5.2 What are the important examination reforms initiated by the university and to what extent have they been implemented in the university departments and affiliated colleges? Cite a few examples which have positively impacted the examination management system. The Institute follows continuous evaluation methods in which weightage is assigned to various types of assignments, exams, quizzes, projects, etc. within the scheme of the course. The final grade depends on the cumulative performance of a student in any course. The academic calendar allows instructors to conduct two in-semester examinations and an end-semester examination for courses offered in a semester. The examination pattern is decided by the instructor and communicated to students in the beginning of the semester. Typical examination patterns include closed book, open book, objective, subjective, multiple choice, etc. If student misses any exams due to ill health or family urgencies, then the respective course instructor arranges make up exams/labs within two weeks after the missed exams schedule. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 102 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.5.3 What is the average time taken by the University for Declaration of examination results? In case of delay, what measures have been taken to address them? Indicate the mode / media adopted by the University for the Publication of examination results (e.g., website, SMS, email, etc.). Results are declared within a week, after the last day of the examinations. The announced results course wise, semester performance index and cumulative performance index of students are shown in the e-campus system (institutes registration and evaluation management system). Students are enabled to log on to the institutes e-campus to see their individual results. All our academic activities adhere strictly the academic calendar. 2.5.4 How does the university ensure transparency in the evaluation process? What are the rigorous features introduced by the university to ensure confidentiality? Students are given the opportunity to inspect the marks awarded for all components of the evaluation process and to see their examination answer-books prior to the declaration of results.

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 103 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2.5.5 Does the university have an integrated examination platform for the following processes? * Pre-examination processes  Time table generation, OMR, student list generation, invigilators, squads, attendance sheet, online payment gateway, etc. * Examination process  Examination material management, logistics, etc. * Post-examination process  Attendance capture, OMR based exam result, auto processing, generic result processing, certification, etc. * Pre-Examination process UG Convenor, in cooperation with the Registrars office, prepares for examination timetable, student list, invigilation plan, attendance sheet, and examination room assignment to courses. The student registration list course wise is obtained from the e-campus database, by which the attendance sheet is generated and seat allocations are planned. The invigilation plan for faculty and Teaching Assistant is prepared and communicated to concerned people a week before. The exams timetable along with exams guideline is emailed to students, faculty and staff. The timetable is also placed in the Academic folder of the institutes intranet. * Examination Material Management Examination material (e.g. answer books, supplementary, pencil, graph paper) for conducting the examinations is procured well in advance by academic administration. The question paper is kept by the course instructor who is one of the invigilators of his/her course. The invigilators receive the duly packed question papers from the course instructor, and conducts examinations. The overall coordination of the examinations process happens under the supervision of the UG Convenor and/or a senior UG committee member. * Post Examination process The instructors are given the answer books and the student attendance sheet of their respective exams. The instructors complete the evaluation of the answer books and upload the final grades of students in e-campus. The hardcopy of the grades, question paper, and attendance sheet are duly signed and submitted to Registrars office that completes the course grading requirement. After NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 104 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology collecting grades of all courses, typically in a weeks time, the Registrars office announces the semesters result in the e-campus, where students can see their results. 2.5.6 Has the university introduced any reforms in its Ph.D. evaluation process? The PhD evaluation process is similar to other premier institutions. Once a PhD student completes the stipulated course work and clears the comprehensive examination, the Dean (AP) constitute a Research Progress Committee (RPC) comprising with three faculty member including the PhD supervisor for evaluating the students progress in every semester. The RPC evaluates the progress in every semester made by the student and provides feedback/suggestion accordingly. Before the thesis submission, a pre-synopsis presentation is evaluated by a separate committee to judge the quality and the quantity of the work that has been carried out by the student. After getting positive feedback from the pre-synopsis committee, the student is permitted to submit his/her thesis. The thesis is evaluated by two examiners, at least one of which is normally from overseas. Once the thesis examiners accept the thesis, the Dean (AP) asks the student to defend his/her thesis. In the PhD thesis defense, at least one external examiner attends the presentation made by the students. We also invite the overseas examiner to attend the presentation through video conference. 2.5.7 Has the university created any provision for including the name of the college in the degree certificate? Not applicable. DA-IICT is a unitary university. 2.5.8 What is the mechanism for redressal of grievances with reference to examinations? The Institute has a formal mechanism in place for addressing all grievances pertaining to examinations. To address student grievances for examinations, the following mechanism is carried out at various levels at the institute:  The Institute has an elected Academic Committee of SBG (Student Body Government), which acts as an interface between the student community and the faculty for all academic matters. All the suggestions regarding academic NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 105 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology issues by students are brought to this Committee, which, after discussion and consultation, passes on the suggestions to the UG and/or PG Committee. After the discussions in this committee the matter is passed onto Dean-AP for appropriate actions.  The Academic Committee of SBG is mentored by the Dean-AP. The academic calendar stating the schedule of all examinations (in-semester and end-semester) is communicated to all students by the Registrars office well in advance before commencement of the academic session. If any complaints noticed by the Academic Committee of SBG or student(s), then they bring the matter to the notice of UG/PG committee and to Dean-AP. Dean-AP in consultation with UG and PG committees addresses the matter appropriately and forwards the recommendation (if any) to the Registrars office. The Registrars office, then, can amend the examinations schedule appropriately and can submit the same for approval of the Academic Council of the Institute.  For each course, the instructor announces the grading policy in the very first lecture of the course. The grading policy details about the various components of the course and the weightage attached to each component (e.g. in-semester exam, end-semester exam, quizzes, assignments, presentations). If a student has any complaints on quizzes or assignments then he/she talks to the respective instructor and resolves the issues. If the complaint is related to in- semester or end-semester exam then the matter is referred to Dean-AP, who then in consultation with UG/PG convener instructs the course instructor to take needful action (e.g. make-up test, re-exam, re-checking) on the matter.  For any complaints related to marks or grade, the matter is referred to the course instructor. The instructor shows the answer sheet and clarifies the points wherever the student has complaints. If the matter is eligible for marks/grade improvement then the instructor submits a hardcopy form in the prescribed form for grade improvement with justification for improvement to Dean-AP. Then, Dean-AP checks its correctness and forwards the form to Registrars office and the modified grade is then reflected in the students grade sheet accordingly. If the grievances are unresolved, then Dean-AP NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 106 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology consults with the Director and refers the complaints to an expert (internal/external) adjudicator. With the aforementioned efforts of Dean-AP, UG and PG committee, instructors and student coordinators the institute is able to resolve all grievances pertaining to examination promptly and effectively. From the academic year 2015-16, the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) has been constituted with Dean-AP as Chairman of the committee. 2.5.9 What efforts have been made by the university to streamline the operations at the Office of the Controller of Examinations? Mention any significant efforts which have improved the process and functioning of the examination division/section. A strong network comprising of Dean (AP), Convenors UG and PG along with Registrar, Dy. Registrar and Asst. Registrar form a team to roll out the responsibilities of the office of the Controller of Examination. Since the Institute runs programmes in one discipline, no separate Office of the Controller of Examinations is required.

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 112 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3.1 Promotion of Research 3.1.1 Does the university have a Research Committee to monitor and address issues related to research? If yes, what is its composition? Mention a few recommendations which have been implemented and their impact. DA-IICT works on the concept of no departments. All faculty members are PhDs and pursue basic research in the areas of their specialisation. Dean (R&D) is tasked with the responsibility of facilitating research and development activities. He helps raise awareness of funding opportunities to support faculty research, and oversees systems and processes related to externally funded projects. The Deans office implements policies and procedures relating to the following matters: [Annexure 3.1.1] 1. Carrying out any sponsored project, consultancy project, including manpower requirement/ appointment for these; 2. Submission of project proposals to the funding agencies; and organisation and /or participation in workshops, seminars and conferences. All sponsored projects are monitored by an internal committee consisting of the Director, Dean (R&D) and PI of the respective project. There is a purchase policy for externally sponsored projects.  For capital expenditures of Rs. 20,000/- or above, approval of Dean (R&D) is required.  For capital expenditures of Rs 1 lakh or above, a purchase committee is constituted by Dean (R&D). Dean (R&D) also oversees conference travel funding for faculty and research scholars. There is an Institute-wide policy to support presentation of research papers by faculty and research scholars at academic conferences in India or abroad. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 113 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3.1.2 What is the policy of the university to promote research in its affiliated / constituent colleges? DA-IICT is a unitary university with no affiliated colleges. 3.1.3 What are the proactive mechanisms adopted by the university to facilitate the smooth implementation of research schemes/ projects? advancing funds for sanctioned projects In case of any delay in release of sanctioned funds, Institute permits PI to overdraw on manpower head to ensure smooth functioning of the project. providing seed money New faculty members are eligible for seed funding on submission of a research proposal. The seed funding is a one-time grant to help conduct preliminary research work needed to garner external funding. This funding can be used to purchase equipment and software that are unavailable. Findings emanating out of this grant may lead to a major funded project. simplification of procedures related to sanctions / purchases to be made by the investigators All project items are purchased using the Institute approved purchase policy. The purchase policy allows the PIs to self-approve purchase of capital items costing upto Rs. 20,000/-. It also allows PIs to make cash purchases upto Rs 10,000/- per month without prior sanction. autonomy to the principal investigator/coordinator for utilizing overhead charges The overhead charges are used to support the professional development of the faculty. The Institute utilizes overhead charges towards research and development activities and not for any other expenditure. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 114 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology timely release of grants The project start date is treated as the date of receipt of the first instalment of the grant. In case of any delay in release of subsequent instalments, Institute permits overdrawing against manpower sub-head of respective project fund. This is done to ensure that salaries of project staff are not stopped. timely auditing The Institute facilitates timely audit. All R&D accounts are audited by a statutory auditor at the end of the financial year. The auditor certifies whether the accounts are maintained as per requirements of the funding agency. submission of utilization certificate to the funding authorities Deans office coordinates with the PIs to ensure that the utilization certificates are sent in a timely manner. UC and other financial documents are prepared by accounts office on request of the PI. Upon project closure and completion of auditing, unutilized funds, if any, are immediately returned to the funding authorities, along with the relevant financial statements. 3.1.4 How is interdisciplinary research promoted?  between/among different departments /schools of the university The Institute is focused on education and research in the discipline of ICT, an interdisciplinary field formed by the coming together of certain fields in electronics, computer science, communication and information technology. To promote research in ICT, the Institute has chosen to have a single multidisciplinary faculty body, instead of one divided into separate departments. A strong social science, humanities and design faculty group exists at DA-IICT, which works in tandem with the engineering group. Most of the programs and specializations have been consciously designed to promote interdisciplinary work. This includes joint guidance of students by faculty from different specializations. At the MTech level, students from one specialization have freedom in choice of thesis topic from another specialization. The NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 115 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology specializations offered are:  Algorithmics  Communication Systems  Computer Networks  Machine Intelligence  Signal Processing  VLSI and Embedded Systems In line with the interdisciplinary philosophy of ICT, a new undergraduate minor in computational science has been introduced to train students to use computational modelling, simulation, visualization, etc. to solve problems in physics, bio-sciences, aeronautics, and many other domains. Institute draws on adjunct faculty to help promote interdisciplinary collaboration and interdisciplinary courses in the curriculum. As an example, an adjunct faculty with expertise in medical field is part of the faculty team offering an undergraduate elective course on medical electronics.

List the social outreach programmes which have created an impact on students campus experience during the last four years. The Institute has a club devoted to social service, Sambhav. The club has always depended on students donations for its functioning; it never took money even from the Institute because the underlying philosophy is learning to give. The programmes undertaken change from year to year depending on the students interests, but usually, the following activities are conducted every year:  Arranging Independence Day celebration for the children from Deaf and Dumb School and Blind School. These children are given snacks and chocolates and every year a trip arranged for them. Last year, they were brought to DA-IICT campus for evening supper which was sponsored by the Institute.  Some students take up the responsibility of teaching the students from municipal schools in the neighbouring areas  The students who leave the campus are encouraged to donate their old books. These books are sold at very concessional rate to the incoming students. The proceeds are used for Sambhavs activities. It inculcates the spirit of giving and co-operation among the senior students and helps the junior students to acquire the text books at very low rates.  The Sambhav team collects old newspapers from the students who subscribe for them. These are sold to the scrap dealer and the money generated is used for Sambhavs activities.  Just before the academic year ends, Sambhav undertakes collection of old clothes. These clothes are sorted, washed and ironed. Then the Sambhav team visits the slum neighbourhoods, and decides which clothes would fit to the inmates of the houses that they visit. Clothes are then donated to them.  Blood donation camp is organized by Sambhav regularly. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 151 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology  On 26th January, Sambhav team, with many other DA-IICT students, visited the old age home and spent time with the inmates.  Recently, a new activity has been introduced that has become very popular. It is called Cyclothon. The old cycles that were left behind by the graduated students together with the new ones that are not used much by the current students were gathered and are put out for hire. Students could hire them just for Rs. 5 for an hour. The booking is done on the website developed by the students themselves. Everyday, the cycles are hired out at least for 10-15 hours. Students have started going out in group bicycling in the morning and evening. The activity is catching up and donations will be sought for purchasing some more cycles. The money collected from hiring will be used for maintaining the cycles. 3.6.2 How does the university promote university-neighbourhood network and student engagement, contributing to the holistic development of students and sustained community development? As mentioned above, the Sambhav Club visits the old age home, orphanage, blind school and deaf and dumb school twice a year. In addition, students of a nearby municipal school were taught by the DA-IICT students. For a brief period, the students also took up teaching the children of the construction workers in the nearby lane who were migrant workers and whose children were not going to school. Clothes were distributed to nearby slum dwellers. For some years, the students adopted a slum in Maninagar and hired a tuition teacher with their money to teach the school going children. Efforts have been made through student projects and other activities to reach out to the not-so-educated sections. For example, a BTP project attempted to get a mobile application developed for the canteen staff to learn English alphabets. Within the course structure also, there are some arrangements to reach out to students, engage them fruitfully to lead to their holistic development. One example is the language course, PC 105. It is primarily taught to address the language (English) deficit needs of the students. However, this deficit is NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 152 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology frequently connected with the class and the socio-economic conditions of the students. Therefore, it is less an academic issue and is more a sociological problem. Hence, the instructor makes sure, to the extent that becomes possible for him/her, to particularly address the students who face obvious disadvantages with respect to language, communication and the attendant disabilities. The instructor does it through some innovations in the pedagogic style: the class is typically organized around various activities. These activities frequently involve combined efforts in the form of well coordinated group and pair work. A plethora of text based games and activities, involving a variety of cognitive challenges, feature as part of the instruction. The classroom is viewed as a zone of interaction and active language flow allows a lot of lateral learning to take place. And our experience shows that generally there is some noticeable improvement in students' performance, especially of the needy ones, over the semester. 3.6.3 How does the university promote the participation of the students and faculty in extension activities including participation in NSS, NCC, YRC and other National/ International programmes? The Institute has obtained relevant approvals for starting the NSS chapter. However, all extension activities have been executed under various student clubs. One such club which has been spearheading activities with societal cause has been Sambhav. There are a series of initiatives undertaken by Sambhav as enumerated in section 5.1.2 of SSR. The Institute has applied to the local NCC Commandant for starting NCC-Air Force wing in the Institute and the same is under process. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 153 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3.6.4 Give details of social surveys, research or extension work, if any, undertaken by the university to ensure social justice and empower the underprivileged and the most vulnerable sections of society? This is done through various social science and humanities courses. For example, in the class of Systems, Policies and Analysis, it is mandatory for the students to conduct surveys on PDS, government health services, accessibility of inputs for farmers, marketing opportunities for farmers, credit facilities available for the poor families etc. When students go to the field to interview the families, they invariably end up telling them about the government schemes, rules regarding PDS, etc. It has always been an enriching experience for all involved. In the summer/winter break, many of us carry out surveys for our research work. Students visit to all the major slums of Ahmedabad city to understand the water situation. A paper based on this survey was presented in a conference to explain the extent of water insecurity that people face. The research was also published as a chapter in a book. During the rural internship, described in question 3.6.6, students often carry out surveys to help NGOs in setting the baseline conditions. The Institute has helped many voluntary organizations in designing their programs with its expertise so that they could reach the underprivileged more effectively. For example, four students did their BTP project for AkshayPatra, to chart out optimal path for the vans that reach out to almost 1 lakh students in various schools. Similarly, the governments e-gram centres were helped by the students in sprucing up their facilities  first the needs assessment for the rural population was done and later software programs were developed to be included in the e-gram network. Our students have helped deaf and dumb school by gathering videos and educational games for their students and conducting training for the instructors, developed a software for a small bank in Saurashtra for its human resource management because it had no access to such programs, carried out surveys regarding environment effects of Mundra port for Center for Environment Education, and such. The examples are too many to site here because many different courses  NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 154 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology technical as well as social science  include such exercises that reach out to the outside community. 3.6.5 Does the university have a mechanism to track the students involvement in various social movements / activities which promote citizenship roles? All such activities are managed through the various student clubs. Each generate compiles a report for all the activities during the academic year. The club also prepares a budget projection for the next year. 3.6.6 Bearing in mind the objectives and expected outcomes of the extension activities organized by the university, how did they complement students academic learning experience? Specify the values inculcated and skills learnt. The B. Tech. curriculum mandates that all students to undertake a four-week Rural Internship at the end of their Third Semester. The objective of the Internship is to expose the Information and Communication Technology students to the social and economic realities of the rural lives and livelihoods; sensitize them to the vulnerabilities of rural people; and help them to appreciate the constraints and opportunities for development. Rural Internship thus entails placing students in villages across India to work in a nongovernmental organization engaged in socio-economic development. Most organizations with which the student chose to affiliate provided students with specific projects. The projects undertaken have been in broad areas of education, poverty alleviation, health, sanitation, rural information and communication systems, ecology and environment, biodiversity, rural governance, agriculture, and citizen rights, etc. In the past, our experience has been very encouraging, and the organizations to which students were attached found the partnership fruitful. The internship has positively added value to their education while contributing meaningfully to the civil society organizations efforts towards rural re-construction. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 155 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology An evidence of success is the consistently good feedback received from the NGOs about the students. Another evidence of the success of the programme is the testimonials that the students have written about their experiences in the villages. Some of the students have posted blogs about the experiences and others have sent written testimonials. For many students this has been eye opening and one of the most memorable experiences in their undergraduate study. See appendix for details. 3.6.7 How does the university ensure the involvement of the community in its outreach activities and contribute to community development? Give details of the initiatives of the university which have encouraged community participation in its activities. Youth Run Youth run was an initiative by a group of students who wanted to promote good health, camaraderie and social awareness. The Youth run vision was to run for a social cause. The run was held every year for three years in the month of February. DA-IICT Students, many from the Gandhinagar community and local school children would participate in a 4km or 8km run in the wee hours of the morning. Around 1000 persons running together in cold during the early morning early made for a wonderful sight. The run usually ended with some light snacks and a talk and interaction session with an imminent person on a theme related to social awareness. Profits of Youth run were given to an NGO. Synapse Synapse has become one of the most successful cultural festivals in Gujarat. For the participants from various colleges, it is a time of showcasing their talents and for the student committee and organizers of DA-IICT, it is a test of their management skills. In the end, it is an enriching experience for the student community of the region. Apart from the big budget events Synapse is a time where one notices many small successes. One such success story in Synapse has been the growth of the debate club at the Institute. This year we had participation NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 156 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology of teams from all over India. The debate event got sponsorship from Govt. of Gujarat and department of science and technology to the tune of 2.5 Lakh. Similarly, the sports festival, Concourse, has been getting the student community involved. 3.6.8 Give details of awards received by the institution for extension activities and/contributions to social/community development during the last four years. Prof. Vishvajit Pandya serves as Honorary Director of Andaman and Nicobar Tribal Research Institute. Some of the other contributions to social and community development are:  Design and installation of community solar cooker unit at SEWA office, Radhanpur.  Arid green greenhouse cropping trials, Kothara, Kutch.  Dew harvesting technology, Kothara, Kutch. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 157 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3.7 Collaboration 3.7.1 How has the universitys collaboration with other agencies impacted the visibility, identity and diversity of activities on campus? To what extent has the university benefitted academically and financially because of collaborations? DA-IICT has signed an MOU with the Indian Navy under which the Navy can nominate qualified naval officers for MTech and PhD Programs at DA-IICT and carry out joint research, development and training projects. Presently, three young naval officers have joined the programme under this arrangement. DA-IICT has signed MoU with the Space Applications Centre (SAC) of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to admit their scientists into the PhD programme. The candidates are selected after a rigorous admission screening carried out at SAC, followed by interview by a Selection Committee at DA-IICT. Presently, there are six officers going through the doctoral studies. 3.7.2 Mention specific examples of how these linkages promote  Curriculum development The Board of Studies has representatives from TCS and Space Application Centre, ISRO.

Extension, NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 162 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Criterion IV - Infrastructure and Learning Resources: This criterion seeks to elicit data on the adequacy and optimal use of the facilities available at DA-IICT to maintain the quality of academic and other programmes on the campus. It also presents information on how every constituent of the university: students, teachers and staff - benefit from these facilities. Expansion of facilities to meet future development is included among other concerns. The focus of this criterion is captured in the following Key Aspects: 4.1 Physical Facilities DA-IICT, Gandhinagar, is a university under State Act of Gujarat and was established in 2001 as a pioneering university that introduced the engineering discipline Information and Communication Technology at the undergraduate level in India. It is recognised by the University Grants Commission (UGC) under section 2f of the UGC Act, 1956. Adequate infrastructure facilities are of utmost importance for the effective and efficient conduct of the educational programmes for any University. The growth of the infrastructure thus has to keep pace with the academic developments in the institution. The other supportive facilities on the campus are developed to contribute to the effective ambience for curricular, extra- curricular and administrative activities. 4.1.1 How does the university plan and ensure adequate availability of physical infrastructure and ensure its optimal utilization? The Academic Calendar of the university is prepared keeping in mind the effective utilisation of the physical infrastructure and the semester time tables are prepared and courses are assigned to different class rooms depending on the registrations for the various courses. For example: All core courses of BTech. (ICT) are conducted in the lecture theatres. In addition to the core courses, the Institute offers a variety of electives, which students can choose freely. Therefore, other class rooms of varying seating capacity are assigned depending on the number of students that have registered for a specific elective. [Annexure 4.1.1.1] NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 163 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology All lecture theatres and the larger class rooms are multimedia enabled and are equipped with a computer and projection facilities along with a document camera. Collar and podium microphones are available to ensure that the lecture is clearly audible in all parts of the room. Shared folders on the intranet are used by the faculty to keep material that are pertinent for a course, and the students have a 24/7 access to these folders from anywhere within the campus. Access to the Resource Centre is available to the students, faculty and staff, beyond regular class hours, upto midnight during a regular semester and extended beyond midnight during examinations. Students also have access to the labs, both instructional and research labs, beyond the office hours. The laboratories in the Lab Building are assigned keeping in mind their maximum utilisation. The labs in the ground floor are primarily used as instructional labs that use computers. The labs in the first floor are used for more specific needs like Electronics Lab, Networks Lab, etc. The research labs on the second floor cater to the students who work in the various research groups that are active at DA-IICT. Optimum utilisation of the labs is ensured by ensuring that the same lab is used for courses that have similar infrastructural requirements in the different semesters. Also a general purpose laboratory is available to the students round the clock. Lecture Theatre A cyclical evaluation of infrastructure is made on the basis of annual surveys for infrastructure in two categories  long and short term. Budgets are proposed and NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 164 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology approvals are sought on an overall priority basis from the Director. This would include maintenance and procurement of new items. [Annexure 4.1.1.2] 4.1.2 Does the university have a policy for the creation and enhancement of infrastructure in order to promote a good teaching-learning environment? If yes, mention a few recent initiatives. DA-IICT uses the intranet to store, share and disseminate information related to the various courses and also the rules and regulations for the students of the various programs. Shared network folders are used to keep the lectures and relevant material for a course and the faculty, Teaching Assistants (TAs) and students can access this from anywhere within the campus. DA-IICT also subscribes to a host of e-resources like journals, online books and other reference materials. High speed Internet and Intranet connectivity allows faculty, staff and students to easily access these material from anywhere within the campus. Laboratories are available for all courses that have a lab component. All labs are equipped with appropriate hardware and software for each course based on the requirements specified by the faculty members who would be teaching the course in the next semester. This is typically done at the end of each semester. For each financial year the ICT committee addresses the issue of up-gradation for the labs and a part of the budget is annually allocated for the purpose. New equipment is ordered for any additions and alterations that are made in the lab component of the courses. The ICT team along with the system administrator provides support with open source material that might be required for various courses based on the instructors requirements. Lab hours are extended beyond academic hours to students for additional hands- on practice and to strengthen the learning and teaching process. Proper utilisation of the lab resources are ensured while preparing the lab timetable for the semester. In addition the students can access the lab and use it beyond office hours for courses that have a formal lab component as well as for those courses that do not have a formal lab component. This allows the students to design and develop computer/other hardware and software based experiments that enrich the NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 165 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology teaching-learning experience of the students. It also enables them to become self- learners, that is an important requirement for all engineers in general and ICT engineers in particular, due to the rapid pace with which the technology is changing in this area. As a step towards decentralizing the decision making process for purchase of ICT related equipment, the ICT Convenor is empowered to approve purchases upto 1 lakh. Different Institute authorities are empowered to approve purchases with different limits. The table below lists the limits of approval for different authorities at DA-IICT. Approving limits for different Institute Authorities Sr.No Role Approving Limit (Rs) Remarks 1 Registrar 1,00,000/- General purpose 2 Dean (R & D) 1,00,000/- Research related 3 Convenor, ICT Committee 1,00,000/- ICT All lab equipments are evaluated and assessed for relevance annually to keep the labs current and industry relevant. A couple of recent initiatives include the setting up of the Computational Science Programme Laboratory and the Language Laboratory. The Computational science programme is set up to impart knowledge to the students and to help them build computational models to understand, analyze and address fundamental problems in science in areas of societal importance. The programme is focused on two main lines  theoretical learning and practical implementation. The programme commences with basic courses on computer science, programming, mathematics and physics that later imparts advanced mathematical methods that are necessary in building computational models to acquire a broad understanding of scientific modelling and simulation. An emphasis in the computational science programme is to train students on how to implement/simulate computational models on state-of-the-art computer architectures and acquire the necessary skills in the area of High Performance Computing. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 166 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology [Annexure 4.1.2.1] The lab is a dedicated well-equipped facility with a capacity for 65 students.

The programme is usually held in two parts. The first is an interaction between the faculty and the alumni in the morning and the second is an interaction between the alumni and current students in the evening. It is proposed to establish an Alumni Account to which an alumni can contribute; this fund can be utilized to support the travel of the students to attend national/international conferences to present their research papers. Recently, alumnis help has been sought for assisting the students in summer internships. Apart from the yearly meet at the campus, the alumni activities also take place at various cities in India including NCR, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad and in the USA (Boston).

The complaint management mechanism (followed so far) is carried out at various levels at DA-IICT: [Annexure 5.1.16]  Minor grievance issues are handled by the elected Student Body Government (SBG). SBG consists of seven main committees - each headed by a faculty mentor, student convenor and student representatives. The student conveners and faculty mentors of various committees act as facilitators to communicate and sort out the grievances pertaining to them. These committees are  Academic, Cultural, Sports, Cafeteria Management, Hostel Management, Student Placement and Annual Festival. The Academic Committee acts as an interface between the student community and the faculty for academic issues. All the suggestions regarding academic issues are brought to this Committee, which, after discussion and consultation, will pass on the suggestions to the UG or PG Committee. After the discussions in this committee the matter is passed onto Dean (Academic Programs) for appropriate actions.  The class/course level grievances are attended by the concerned course instructors / faculty tutors / teaching assistants (TAs).  Unresolved grievances are referred to the respective Deans / Director of DA- IICT. Depending on the seriousness of the problem, the issues are settled in consultation with other faculty members / hostel wardens / hostel supervisors. The collective efforts of various faculty and student coordinators resolve the complaints promptly and efficiently. Regarding the campus life, DA-IICT has a zero tolerance policy for ragging activities. Anti-ragging Committee and Disciplinary Action Committee, with NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 250 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Dean (students) as Convener, play an important role here.

This clearly indicates that we encourage participative management in administering the institute. SBG is a self-governing student organization represented by Student Convener, Secretary, Treasurer, Committee Conveners and members. Dean (Students) is the ex-officio Convener of the SBG. Student representatives are selected by the election (held every year in the month of April) as per the Constitution of SBG. Seven main committees form SBG: Academic, Cultural, Sports, Placement, Annual Festival, Hostel Management, and Cafeteria Management. DA-IICT has student representatives in various academic and administrative bodies like Gender Cell, Disciplinary Action Committee, Anti-Ragging Committee, Alumni Board. The student representatives actively participate in the deliberations in the matter related to student community. 6.1.7 Give details of the academic and administrative leadership provided by the university to its affiliated colleges and the support and encouragement given to them to become autonomous. DA-IICT is a unitary University and therefore this is Not Applicable 6.1.8 Have any provisions been incorporated / introduced in the University Act and Statutes to provide for conferment of degrees by autonomous colleges?

Give details. The Director is supported by three Deans, namely: [Annexure 6.1.9] a) Dean-Academic Programs b) Dean-Research & Development c) Dean-Students In addition, there are multiple committees as listed in 6.1.6 which provides ample opportunity for grooming leadership at various levels. 6.1.10 Has the university evolved a knowledge management strategy? If yes, give details. Yes, the university has a knowledge management strategy through the following sub committees: [Annexure 6.1.10] 1. Resource Centre (RC) Committee The RC Committee compiles data regarding faculty and student publications in reputed Journals and conferences. It also records details with respect to books, articles and book chapters published by the Faculty. The same is made available to all the stake holders through the campus Intranet. The RC committee recommends e-resources based on the interests of faculty and students. The committee also assists the resource centre in hiring better library personnel. 2. Continuing Education Programme (CEP) Committee CEP Committee deals with external connects. Through CEP programs, DA- IICT ensures percolation of knowledge created at the Institute to reach the end users, which may be faculty and employees of various academic/research/industry organizations. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 282 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3. Conferences, seminar workshop, short term courses, summer/vacation classes etc. Conferences, workshop, seminars, short term courses, summer/vacation classes are being organized regularly by the Institute to disseminate knowledge acquired by the faculty while pursuing through research to the fellow students/faculty community. This helps in mutual learning, ensuring information and propagating all innovative ideas amongst the fellow researchers group. Rural Internship Rural Internship is unique to DA-IICT since no other academic institutions in the engineering/technology category have comparable mandatory academic requirement in their curriculums. Rural Internship involves developing student profiles based on their home state, gender, their local language proficiencies, their location preferences among other considerations. Based on their profiles and state preferences reputed NGOs are contacted soliciting their cooperation in placing the students in their areas of operation. Most organizations with which the student chose to affiliate provided students with specific projects. The projects undertaken have been in broad areas of education, poverty alleviation, health, sanitation, rural information and communication systems, ecology and environment, biodiversity, rural governance, agriculture, and citizen rights, etc. Generally two students are placed NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 283 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology in one village (in exceptional cases three students). Once the students have made their choice of NGOs, reporting and project details are provided to students. The students are expected to stay in the villages for the entire duration of 4- weeks. They cannot avail leave during the internship period. Students are permitted to leave their villages only on Sundays (day time only) for purchase of medicines, getting money, food, etc. In the past three years around 50 NGOs from all parts of India have hosted students for Rural Internship. Students successfully completed their internships documenting their observations and experiences. The students shared their experiences and learning with the faculty members and their classmates through a poster session. The evaluation components include submission of a daily diary, a five page report, host organizations feedback, a poster presentation. Ethics Professionals routinely face a number of ethical problems in the complex global society including issues like confidentiality, intellectual property rights, gender bias, and contractual obligations to name a few. Rather than creating a separate course to impart ethics education to the students, we find it more effective to impart it through the actual practice of handling the course components, including evaluations, projects, report writing. We also use ICT tools like Turnitin to monitor cases of plagiarism and proactively sensitize the students to the standards of professional conduct. 6.1.11 How are the following values reflected in the functioning of the university?  Contributing to national development: [Annexure 6.1.11] Faculty from DA-IICT are members of the various committees and governing bodies of renowned academic and research institutions. These committees and governing bodies are decision making entities in their respective institutions. It is in this manner wisdom and experience of faculty at the institute contributes to national development. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 284 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology  Fostering global competencies among students Curricula of all our programs are designed and developed with futuristic vision. Inclusion of social sciences and humanities as full-fledged courses is in itself an indication towards offering progressive curriculum. Also regular short term programs, expert lectures, seminars and workshops are used in augmenting the overall learning requirement of the students. This has indeed helped in fostering global competencies among students.  Inculcating a sound value system among students. As indicated in previous section, inclusion of social sciences and humanities has helped us enormously in inculcation of value system amongst students. Also talks by eminent social scientists at regular intervals have helped us in further strengthening our efforts towards mentoring and guiding our students in becoming responsible citizens. Students are also encouraged and supported in aligning themselves with several activities of societal importance and kindle in them a spark of being responsive to the needs of the fellow human beings. There are multiple student bodies which are in place, most of the time a student driven initiative that is supported by the institute which further aid and abet nurturing of the value system amongst students.  Promoting use of technology Being a tech savvy institute, usage of technology in day to day running of the institute is extended a proactive support.

Continuous Education Programme (CEP): A vigorous CEP programme serves the dual purpose of serving the technical community of Gujarat but helps in generating resources for the institute. 5. Grant in Aid from R-Com: Institute makes efforts to mobilize funds from corporations like R-Com from their CSR activity budgets. [Annexure 6.4.5.5] 6. Mentorship of IIIT-V: DA-IICT has the honour to be entrusted the task of mentorship of IIIT Vadodara. The mentorship fees are additional resource generated by DA-IICT. [Annexure 6.4.5.6] 6.4.6 Is there any provision for the university to create a corpus? If yes, give details. Yes. There is a corpus fund available created under two heads. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 295 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology DA-IICT Trust Corpus 1. DA-IICT Corpus Trust corpus is the funds provided by the promoters and augmented every year. Whereas the fund towards DA-IICT corpus is formed using the surplus generated every year from the income of DA-IICT. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 296 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 6.5 Internal Quality Assurance System 6.5.1 Does the university conduct an academic audit of its departments? If yes, give details. As elaborated upon in the earlier sections, DA-IICT works on the concept of no departments. However, academic progressions of all its programs are conducted on a regular basis through discussions in the UG and PG committees. Ideas and suggestions arising out of such deliberations are minuted and brought before the AC for further consideration, through Dean-Academic Programs, who is also a member of the AC. Thus any course curriculum may undergo changes vis-a-vis its content, mode of delivery, inclusion of practical component, method of evaluation etc in consultation with the AC, on recommendations from UG/PG committees. 6.5.2 Based on the recommendations of the academic audit, what specific measures have been taken by the university to improve teaching, learning and evaluation? As explained in the section 6.5.1, based on the suggestions of the UG and PG committees and approval from the academic council, any course curriculum may undergo changes vis a vis its content, mode of delivery, inclusion of practical component, method of evaluation etc. [Annexure 6.5.2)] 6.5.3 Is there a central body within the university to continuously review the teaching learning process? Give details of its structure, methodologies of operations and outcome? The Institute has constituted its IQAC recently. But the academic bodies performing the role of IQAC, as brought out in the sections 6.5.1 and 6.5.2 are the UG and PG committees, which have the mandate of continuous review of the teaching learning process. [Annexure 6.1.6] The Dean-Academic Programmes office continuously monitors these reviews NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 297 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology and makes relevant recommendations about specific course/courses to the Academic Council for further deliberations and decision. The Academic Councils agenda incorporates all these items for discussion and since has a mandate of meeting twice a year, quick decisions are possible. However, if the issue is contentious and requires immediate decision making, the Director has the mandate to take a decision through an executive order, to be ratified on a later date, as and when the academic council meets. However a broad consensus is built, each time one has to take a policy decision. 6.5.4 How has IQAC contributed to institutionalizing quality assurance strategies and processes? As described earlier, IQAC has been constituted recently. However, the UG and PG committees and the Dean-AP, guided by the AC and the BoG have been able to assure standards and quality in all the matters related to Academic processes. 6.5.5 How many decisions of the IQAC have been placed before the statutory authorities of the university for implementation? As reported, all decisions of the UG and PG committee are placed before the AC through Dean-AP for its consideration, discussion and approval thereon. 6.5.6 Does the IQAC have external members on its committees? If so, mention any significant contribution made by such members. The present IQAC has eminent external members and is constituted in strict adherence to the norms prescribed by UGC/NAAC. However as reported in the previous sections, the BoG, the AC and the curriculum review committees (Board of Studies) have eminent academicians and researchers as its members. Their presence in these committees, bodies has definitely benefitted the institute in terms of obtaining their guidance and advice through their vast experience in field of higher education. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 298 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 6.5.7 Has the IQAC conducted any study on the incremental academic growth of students from disadvantaged sections of society? Linear progress: This study of academic growth of students from the disadvantaged strata of the society is a continuous ongoing process. Since the Institute prescribes strict academic standards, it is the obligation as well as a responsibility of the Institute to constantly monitor their progress and provide the requisite support and assistance to these students through additional mentoring, study hours and remedial classes. A well defined policy towards support for weak students is in place. It is our constant endeavour to provide additional support to such students and help them in satisfactorily coping with the curricular requirements prescribed by the institute. 6.5.8 What policies are in place for the periodic review of administrative and academic departments, subject areas, research centres, etc.? The organizational structure of DA-IICT is well defined in terms of roles and responsibilities of each and every individual who is associated with the institute. The BoG, the AC, the FC, the UG/PG committees and now the IQAC have a clear mandate with respect to conduct of meetings, preparation of agenda and also the delegation of authority. It is therefore a regular and pious affair that these committees meet regularly and exercise their roles and responsibilities, as depicted in the charter of DA-IICT. This not only ensures periodic review of the various components of the organizational set up but also guarantees efficiency in terms of administering the institute as per the vision of its founders to the fullest of our capabilities. DA-IICT publishes its annual report, which is an open document, accessible to everyone on the web. This document comprises of a comprehensive annual report of all activities undertaken at the institute. We get very constructive and valuable suggestions from various strata of stake holders regarding what we have done in the previous years to what could be envisaged and achieved in years to come. [Annexure 6.5.8] NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 299 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Any other information regarding Governance, Leadership and Management which the university would like to include. Source: mhrd.gov.in/sites/upload_files/mhrd/files/upload.../IIITs-Scheme.pdf To address the challenges faced by the lndian IT industry and growth of the domestic IT market, the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Government of India intends to establish twenty Indian Institutes of Information Technology (IIIT), on a Not-for-profit Public Private Partnership (N-PPP) basis. The partners in setting up the IIITs would be the Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD), Governments of the respective States where each IIIT will be established and the industry. To realize its objectives, a IIIT needs an innovative governance structure which allows it to function with autonomy, flexibility and transparency. Autonomy will enable the IIIT to take responsibility for its development and promote accountability and responsibility in the institute's stakeholders; flexibility will enable the IIIT to meet the rapidly changing needs of the IT industry; and transparency is required to satisfy the multiple stakeholders involved in each IIIT that their interests are not being compromised. The proposed governance structure should also be aligned with the current policy and regulatory framework. Additionally, there is also the need for a formal pan -IIIT structure which allows the various IIIT to leverage best practices from each other, co -ordinate common efforts like faculty development, student admission processes, manage the IIIT brand etc. The overall governance framework for the IIITs will involve SG: State Government; CG: Central Government; C P: Corporate Partner; PI: Partner Institute IIIT-Vadodara was set up in the State of Gujarat from the academic year 2013-14 on the proposed PPP mode by MHRD, Government of Gujarat and three industry partners, namely TCS, GERMI and GSFC. Unlike the other states where IIITs where mentored by a Partner Institute which were Government institutions such as IITs or NITs, DA-IICT was selected and accorded the responsibility of mentoring IIIT-Vadodara. This is a very unique model where a Government NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 300 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Institute is being mentored by a private institute. Such decisions are taken with utmost care at higher echelons of administration. This clearly indicates that DA- IICT is recognized as one of the Best Institutes offering higher education in Engineering/Technology and therefore it was bestowed upon the responsibility of mentoring IIIT-Vadodara. This is also a reckoning of good governance at DA- IICT. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 301 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology CRITERION VII: INNOVATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES 7.1 Environment Consciousness DA-IICT infrastructure design itself shows that DA-IICT is very concerned about preserving the environment. DA-IICT is spread over 50 acres of land and out of 50 acres, 80% (approximately 40 acres) open space reserved for green cover and garden to keep the campus green. Lawn Tree cover DA-IICT campus NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 302 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology In addition to maintaining adequate green cover in the form tree canopy, herbs and shrubs and lawns, the natural topography of the campus left unaltered. As a result of which the natural flow of rain water is not disturbed. Overall NDVI, an index of greenness, of the campus is 0.55. [Annexure 7.1] DA-IICT topography As part of environmental consciousness, solid waste management and recycling of waste water is being practiced. DA-IICT keeps continuing the efforts to give its community a healthy, fresh and eco-friendly environment. 7.1.1 Does the university conduct a Green Audit of its campus? DA-IICT from its inception has been very conscious about possible environmental measures so that green cover is maintained. Since green leaves acts as a carbon sink, carbon emission has been assumed to be low. In order to oversee the development of the campus a committee on Environment Protection and Auditing was formed in the year 2011. The committee has meeting time to time to assess and suggest the measures to be taken so that the environmental status does not deteriorate with time. [Annexure 7.1.1] NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 303 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 7.1.2 What are the initiatives taken by the university to make the campus eco- friendly? 1. Title of the Initiative Solid Waste Management 2. Objectives of the Initiative  The main objective of the solid waste management is to maximise the use of the available wastes e.g. dried green leaves, waste generating from food court etc. in a scientific and organic way for maintaining lush green and eco friendly campus. 3. Context In initial stages, it was a great challenge to dispose of daily generated waste. As an environment conscious Institute, it was not proper that the wastes are dumped around. There are two types of wastes, one is dry and one is wet. The main source of dry waste is plastic cups, milk pouches, tins, glass bottles, packaging material, cut vegetables, fruits and other leftover food items. Moreover, huge horticulture wastes are generated on daily basis. The above two types of waste disposal was a great challenge for an environment friendly Institution. At the beginning, it was assumed to address the problem as waste disposal issue. In the end it was decided to address the disposal issue into scientific management of solid waste. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 304 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 4. Methodology Operational Diagram of Vermicompost Plant 5. Evidence of Success The DA-IICT is observing the evidence of success in two stages.  Recycling the waste creates organic fertilizer which is used for campus greenery.  Transportation cost for disposal of the solid and green wastes from the campus is nil. Both the above successes are visible in the campus greenery which is not only giving green cover to the campus but also generates lot of oxygen. 6. Problems Encountered The vermicompost plant setup requires prominent infrastructure which includes material cost as well as manpower cost for its operation. Wastes collect from various campus buildings and cafeteria Horticulture Waste Food Waste Content Plastic cups, milk pouches, tins, glass bottles, packaging material etc. Content Cut vegetables, cut fruits etc. Disposed off by Municipal Corporation Used at wormy compost site for generating organic fertilizer NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 305 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 1. Title of the Initiative Sewage Water Treatment and Recycling for Irrigation 2. Objectives of the Initiative To treat the waste water and recycle the treated water for irrigation purpose in the campus. 3. Context In initial stage, it was a great challenge to dispose of daily used water generated in the campus from various sources. The Institute wanted to use this waste water scientifically by recycling it. The best way found was to set up a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP). The incoming used water quantity for STP is approximately 4 Lac Litres daily. Out of this 4 Lac Litre, 3 Lac Litre treated water is used for irrigation purpose. 4.

Evidence of Success Evidence of success may be described in the following three stages.  Recycled water is used again for the campus greenery through sprinkler irrigation.  Recycling the waste creates organic fertilizer which is used for campus greenery.  Reduced pumping of water from bore well for campus irrigation and thereby saving energy. Above successes are visible in the campus greenery which is not only giving green cover to the campus but also generates lot of oxygen. 6. Problems Encountered The STP plant setup requires infrastructure which includes material cost as well as manpower cost for its operation. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 307 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 7.2 Innovations A. Title of the Project & Year: Automation of pheromone Traps using Raspberry pi- B and Pi camera, 2015. Name of the Investigators: Prof. Rahul Dubey and K Sarvan Sponsor, if any: This project was funded by Barrix Agro Sciences Pvt Ltd as part of internship programme. Before conducting prototype tests lab devices and equipment of DA-IICT were used for hands on experience. Novelty in the project: Can we design a modern pheromone trap, which mostly used for monitoring and controlling insects in field? DA-IICT student in collaboration with Barrix Agro sciences Pvt Ltd took up this challenge as project. For last couple of years, several pheromones came into the market but due to unawareness about the type of the insects and its behaviour the farmer community faced problem while intimating the density of the pest and kind of the pest to research community. If the type of pest in trap is captured and mailed to the scientists they can intimate/advice the farmer for proper precaution. Our team decided to integrate the pheromone trap with Pi camera and Raspberry Pi model Bfor performing various functions as Version 1 project. Establishing Ad-hoc network between Pi board and client were conducted successfully. For capturing the images in trap remotely using LAN have conducted as lab tests using PuTTy and WinSCP software at desired frequency. These captured images can be downloaded and sent to desired persons through mail. Remotely accessing of the captured images by Pi camera can be monitored by Wifi Adapter which was connected to pi board. Using Power bank we have conducted trail tests with in DA-IICT for capturing of the images. Some of the results are excellent and also did image processing study for detection of the pest which helps in version 2 project. The right trade off between Pi and all connected peripherals need to be estimated, because of power constraints and less security to the boards in outside there is chance of tampering. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 308 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Deliverables: Pheromone Trap with Raspberry pi, Picamera, power bank along wi-fi adapter and LAN cable as a complete Kit. Index of success / Outreach: This project was completed during internship on may-2015. This version 1 suggests the change of design for traditional traps which cannot accommodates the image detection and tracking in version 2. DA-IICT lab provided complete assistance and direction to the project. The captured images can only sent to desired person using LAN cable more than Wifi adapter due to poor signal strength and power fluctuation. This type of application encourages more automation in the agricultural field for solving the problems in scientific manner.

Title of the Project& Year: Dew plant for bottling water. 2014 Name of the Investigators: Late Prof. Girja Sharan and Anil K. Roy Sponsor, if any: DST, Govt of India Novelty in the project: The aim of the project is to demonstrate that atmospheric moisture can be harvested and processed into safe drinking water comparable in quality and price to reverse osmosis processed water available in the market. The project deals with the construction and functioning of a water production plant in Kothara village of Kutch district, Gujarat (India). Rain and dew are collected; for dew special care has to be taken. The latest surface consists of a white low density polyethylene (LDPE) film including micro- particles with high infra-red emissivity. Dew yields are estimated from the meteorological data and using Computational Fluid Dynamics simulation. Then the efficiency of the surface is monitored. Deliverables: World largest dew harvesting plant. Water is then filtered by a simple water- filtering unit installed at the site of capacity over 100 L/hour. Later this filtering unit has to be powered by solar energy and an automatic filling unit will fill this potable water in pouches to be commercially sold in the market. Index of success / Outreach: This project was completed and commissioned in Kothara last year with the current surface, LDPE. Now we are planning to increase the efficiency of the plant by changing the surfaces to meta-surfaces and nano-surfaces. This will have global impact.

Title of the Project& Year: High Performance Computing (HPC) Using Cell-Phone Processor SoC, 2014 Name of the Investigators: Prof. Amit Bhatt and Shoeb Chikte Sponsor, if any: Qualcom, USA Novelty in the project: Can we design a HPC cluster under $2000? DA-IICT group in collaboration with Qualcomm took up this challenge. In last couple of years, several development boards containing powerful cell phone processors are available in the market. These boards were originally designed for developing mobile applications on cell-phones. Our team decided to form a cluster of these boards using Linux operating system. A cluster of 4/8 boards was created and several Industry standard bench mark tests for HPC were conducted. These include HPL, graph500 and greengraph500. All the results gave excellent performance/price and performance/power numbers. Deliverables: HPC cluster of 4/8 boards Index of success / Outreach: This project was completed in late 2014. By now 30 students from DA-IICT and 12 students from other institutes have been trained on this. Soon this will become a part of the regular curriculum. The work was extensively covered by the media. [Annexure 7.2.3] NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 312 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology D. Title of the Project& Year: Design of on-line water quality monitoring node, 2013 Name of the Investigators: Prof. Rahul Dubey & Harsh Chawda Sponsor, if any: This project was supported by IEEE Foundation grant Novelty in the project: Water pollution has become a cause of major concern for developing economies such as India. The government has embarked on major programs to ensure that water bodies such as rivers are kept clean. This project aids in continuously monitoring water quality parameters and transmits them to a central computer maintained by state/center pollution control boards. The prototype system was developed was tested in still waters. Deliverables: Prototype of floating on-line water quality monitoring node Index of success / Outreach: An operational floating on-line node using Arduino, Dissolved Oxygen (DO), PH and temperature sensor along with SMS connectivity was developed in May 2013. A framework is now being formed to make this node as part of Internet of Things (IoT) which can monitor different types of water bodies.

Title of the Project & Year: Indoor Navigation System for Visually Impaired People, 2013 Name of the Investigators: Anil K. Roy and team of students Sponsor, if any: NIF, Ahmedabad Novelty in the project: The methods of navigation and approximation of localization for the visually impaired persons have been an interesting and challenging area for the researchers. These are mostly based on RF communication, Geographic Information System (GIS), Global Positioning System (GPS) technique, RFID tags, Wi-Fi positioning, audio feedback system, image processing etc. Our approach introduces an Infrared (IR) based indoor navigation system which uses a map server to get the digital map of the pre-defined route of a building for the visually impaired person. We created a GPS like environment inside the building using a network of IR transmitters which are fixed in the ceilings of the corridors of the said building. The positioning and orientation of the visually impaired person wearing our device are intelligently estimated by a head mounted receiver module which finally guarantees a voice-actuated assistance for exact navigation. We show that our system is low cost, portable, accurate and easy to use which ensures independent movement of a visually impaired person in an enclosed complex surrounding. We further insist that in future all public buildings must be equipped with this system and be termed as Visually Impaired Friendly Buildings. Deliverables: A device that helps a visually challenged person to walk almost like an able bodied person in any building which is VI-Friendly building. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 314 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Index of success / Outreach: Commercial production of this device is in process. Indoor Navigation System NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 315 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology F. Title of the Project& Year: Kinect-O-Therapy, 2012 Name of the Investigators: Anil K. Roy, Yash Soni and Sonali Dubey Sponsor, if any: Nil Novelty in the project: We developed a product, Kinect-o-Therapy, that involved implementation of exercise routines targeting different parts of the body and that aided people with motor disabilities stemming from cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury, post stroke and hereditary muscle ailments amongst others. Kinect-o-Therapy incorporates serious games that process 3D input using the Microsoft Kinect motion sensor to build an effective rehabilitation system which is a plug-and- play type product that gives feedback to the patient and the doctors to monitor the performance. The game environment and feedback mechanism ensure patients involvement and high motivation to carry out these exercise routines regularly. We tested this product on a number of patients and therapists and observed encouraging result. Deliverables: A device that helps in rehabilitation of motor disability persons. Index of success / Outreach: Sensors based serious games has been developed in past also, but Kinect-o- Therapys easy- to-use design, feedback system, data accessibility, scalability and low cost are significant features that make it an attractive alternative of rehabilitation. We now strive for commercial production of this device.

Title of the Project& Year: Rediscovering Ajanta and its component Virtual Vihara 2012 Name of the Investigators: Prof. Binita Desai & Chitra Shriram Sponsor, if any: Novelty in the project: Ajanta is not just a world heritage monument it is a cultural legacy. While Taj is the symbol of romance and travelogue, the Ajanta demands a different form of spectatorship, discovery & learning. The advent of photography brought not only greater exposure to this site but became an integral part of scholarly research on every aspect of Ajanta even as it became a serious archival instrument. Digital photography combined with three dimensional simulation goes a step further in creating a new availability of Ajanta. Virtual access provides opportunities and experiences beyond mere physical presence. It bridges distance and allows for new orientations. Virtuality is a privileging of new forms of spectatorship in art, a new entitlement to the power of the eye. The Virtual Vihara project hopes to be a small demonstration of this potential. It will seek to combine state of the art gaming and simulation technology with large screen display and surround sound to create a portable, interactive installation of Ajanta. The aim is to afford the user-visitor an intimate, self-paced and sensory exploration of one cave from Ajanta. Using input devices such as a mouse, joystick or the Wiimote, the visitor will have multiple modes of navigation including walking, floating, flying at his fingertips. It will be a visceral way to enjoy the architectural space, and views of the mural paintings without perspective distortion. Illumination in the actual Ajanta caves is necessarily kept at low levels for maximum preservation of the murals. In our system, we provide control of the illumination to the visitor through a virtual flashlight. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 318 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology The virtual space will be defined as much by the sound as by the visual elements that demarcate it. As the visitor examines different areas, various streams of sound will fade in and out; such evocative sound will give resonance to the images, providing spatial cues and cumulatively elevating the sensory experience into the realm of meaning and significance. Within this immersive stage, the user/visitor will encounter figures, birds and beasts from the murals, no longer affixed to the walls but capable of free movement, going about their roles in the narratives from which they emerge. Enactment and interaction intersect. The stage will be set for a new aesthetic experience. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 319 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 7.3 Best Practices Title of the Practice Rural Internship for BTech students Objectives of the Practice  Expose students to rural India; work on social projects in collaboration with NGOs that may also involve use of ICT.  Spread across the villages working closely with various nongovernmental organizations for a period of one month.  Contribute to the objectives and activities of your host organization. The Context What were the contextual features or challenging issues that needed to be addressed in designing and implementing this practice (in about 150 words?) The B Tech curriculum mandates that all students to undertake a four-week Rural Internship at the end of their third semester. The objective of the internship is to expose the Information and Communication Technology students to the social and economic realities of the rural lives and livelihoods; sensitize them to the vulnerabilities of rural people; and help them to appreciate the constraints and opportunities for development. Rural internship thus entails placing students in villages across India to work in a nongovernmental organization engaged in socio-economic development. The responsibility of the host organisation includes providing an initial briefing, day-to-day supervision and guidance, help in finding lodging and boarding, possibly as a paying guest with a village family, and evaluation of his or her work. In the past, our experience has been very encouraging, and the organizations to which students were attached found the partnership fruitful. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 320 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology The Practice Describe the practice and its uniqueness in the context of India higher education. What were the constraints / limitations, if any, faced (in about 400 words)? Rural internship is unique to DA-IICT since no other academic institutions in the engineering/ technology category have comparable mandatory academic requirement in their curriculums. Rural Internship involves developing student profiles based on their home state, gender, their local language proficiencies, their location preferences among other considerations. Based on their profiles and State preferences reputed NGOs are contacted soliciting their cooperation in placing the students in their areas of operation. Most organizations with which the student chose to affiliate provided students with specific projects. The projects undertaken have been in broad areas of education, poverty alleviation, health, sanitation, rural information and communication systems, ecology and environment, biodiversity, rural governance, agriculture, and citizen rights, etc. Generally two students are placed in one village (in exceptional cases three students). Once the students have made their choice of NGOs, reporting and project details are provided to students. The students are expected to stay in the villages for the entire duration of 4- weeks. They cannot avail leave during the internship period. Students are permitted to leave their villages only on Sundays (day time only) for purchase of medicines, getting money, food, etc. In the past three years around 50 NGOs from all parts of India have hosted students for Rural Internship. Students successfully completed their internships documenting their observations and experiences. The students shared their experiences and learning with the faculty members and their classmates through a poster session. The evaluation components include submission of a daily Dairy, a five page report, host organizations feedback, a poster presentation. Partial lists of organizations include: NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 321 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Godavari Mahasamakhya, Sri Gowthami Urban And Rural Integrated Development and Educational Society, Ramakrishna Sarada Sevashram, Abhyan, Banas Dairy, Shri Bolbala Trust, Cohesion Foundation, DHRUVA, DISHA, GRESERV, GraminVikas Trust Dahod, Ishwar Gram Vikas Trust, Mehsana Milk Union, Navjeevan Trust, Society for Integrated Land & Water Management, Sristi, Tribhuvandas Foundation, UNNATI, UTTHAN, Valsad Milk Union, SUTRA, North Himalayan Environment Protection And Education Society, Savigya, Aajeevika Bureau, AFPRO, Astha, Foundation for Ecological Security, Gramin Vikas Trust Rajasthan, Jatan Sansthan, Himalayan Environmental Studies & Conservation Org., Himalayan Institute For Environment, Peoples Science Institute. The internship has positively added value to their education while contributing meaningfully to the civil society organizations efforts towards rural re- construction. Some of the constraints encountered include placing approximately 275 students each year with NGOs in different States in approximately 120-125 villages, arranging for their stay and food is a challenging task. The entire process from developing student profiles in the first fortnight of August to the final evaluation in February  March is also challenging assignment. Evidence of Success Provide evidence of success such as performance against targets and benchmarks, review results. What do these results indicate? Describe in about 200 words. Since Rural Internship is unique to DA-IICT and no other academic institutions have such mandatory academic requirements, it is difficult to compare with targets and benchmarks. An evidence of success is the consistently good feedback received from the NGOs about the students. At the end of the rural internship period the supervisor of each and every student is required to fill a feedback form on the performance of the student during his/her internship period. The feedback forms can be made available upon request. Another evidence of the success of the NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 322 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology programme is the testimonials that the students have written about their experiences in the villages. Some of the students have posted blogs about the experiences and others have sent written testimonials. For many students this has been eye opening and one of the most memorable experiences in their undergraduate study. [Annexure 7.3.1] Problems Encountered and Resources Required Please identify the problems encountered and resources required to implement the practice (in about 150 words). "Most private run so called philanthropic organizations do not understand their social responsibilities. 99% of the existing NGOs are fraud and simply moneymaking devices. Only one out of every hundred NGOs serve the purpose they are set up for", a bench headed by Justice Pradeep Nandrajog said. (http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/99-ngos-are-fraud-money-making- devices-hc/article1-1021701.aspx) Identifying genuine organizations for Rural Internship is a prerequisite ensuring not only safety and security of students but also providing them with a pleasant experience for learning. Organizing Rural Internship with legitimate organizations is a daunting task, especially in technology related academic institutions. There are many educational institutions also looking for genuine organizations to place their students putting pressure on the organizations to host students. Many organizations do not respond to the request to host students for Rural Internship. On an average, each organization has to be contacted 8  10 times by email, telephone, etc., to obtain a response. From the students point of view, nervousness and fear, language and communication problem, disciplinary problem, lack of cooperation from organizations & supervisors, personal and miscellaneous problems such as health, food, conflict are major issues. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 323 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Title of the Practice Pre Placement Activities at DA-IICT Objectives of the Practice  To prepare the students for placements in the IT and Communications industry  To improve their technical and soft skills to make them better prepared for jobs in the industry. The Context What were the contextual features or challenging issues that needed to be addressed in designing and implementing this practice (in about 150 words?) The IT and Communications industry, being a rapidly growing and evolving industry, has become more demanding than ever. A student aiming to make a career in these domains needs to have an equal hold over both technical and soft skills. The pre-placement activities conducted by the Placement Cell, DA-IICT aim at this overall growth of the student. Frequent aptitude and technical tests, of varying levels of difficulty; keep the students on their toes.

NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 324 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology The Practice Describe the practice and its uniqueness in the context of India higher education. What were the constraints / limitations, if any, faced (in about 400 words)? The Student Placement Committee, DA-IICT is a student body associated with the placement process at DA-IICT. The committee is mentored by Convener, Placement Committee. The Placement Committee works professionally to ensure a smooth placement process. In addition, it also organizes various pre- placement activities for the benefit of student body. The world of technology is constantly changing and the recruiting companies want something more than good grades. They look for an individual with knowledge in the relevant area. The Placement Cell conducts various tests with multiple choice questions throughout the semester to boost the students confidence in both aptitude and technology. The questions asked, are from various topics like Data Structures and Algorithms, Operating Systems, Computer Networks and Systems Software. The questions vary in the level of difficulty, and are prepared by experts in the respective domains. Apart from technical expertise, soft skills are need of the time. A student needs to be able to convey his/her knowledge and capability to the possible recruiter. The students are given an opportunity to sharpen their soft skills by organizing Group Discussions. These discussions are held by senior students of the SPC and Debate Club, DA-IICT. Group discussions are also held by recognized organizations like TIME and Endeavour so that students can see where they stand according to the current trends. NAAC Self Study Report - 2015 325 Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Evidence of Success Provide evidence of success such as performance against targets and benchmarks, review results. What do these results indicate? Describe in about 200 words. The results of these activities have been seen in the placement statistics of DA- IICT. The Institute has seen an ever increasing number of placements, and many students have attributed their success to the pre-placement activities conducted by the institute. Detailed scores and analysis given after each test and activity help the student review their progress. The students have appreciated these activities as they help in increasing their confidence. And the improvement has indeed been seen. Students have become familiar with the group discussion etiquette and are better able to put their ideas across the table. This thorough process prepares the students for the actual placements, so that they are not completely at sea during the process. Problems Encountered and Resources Required Please identify the problems encountered and resources required to implement the practice (in about 150 words). With the aim of preparing students for placements, maximum tests and group discussions need to be organized. At times, deciding dates for the tests, so as to benefit maximum students, becomes a problem. In keeping with the evolving technology, sometimes it becomes an issue to get the right technical platform to conduct the tests and the required space to accommodate the students. More experienced people are needed in order to conduct better Group Discussions and these Group Discussions need to be more frequent as many students face the problem of public speaking. To conduct more Group Discussions, more space is needed. Also, a better and more organized way of keeping a record of each students progress will definitely go a long way in helping the students for placements.
