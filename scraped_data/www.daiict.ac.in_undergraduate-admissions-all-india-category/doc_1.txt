Information & Communication Technology Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology DA-IICT was founded in 2000 as a unique university devoted to the cutting-edge interdisciplinary area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). ICT was emerging as the technology of the future bringing in the fourth Industrial Revolution. Well known and highly qualified faculty members joined DA-IICT and developed a curriculum and research program steeped in all aspects of ICT, societal, scientific, and technical. This spirit has been nurtured for the last 24 years and DA-IICT wants to continue its excellence in interdisciplinary teaching and research well into the future. The Act No. 6 of 2003 of the Gujarat Legislature provided for the establishment of the DA-IICT and conferred on it the status of a University. On 30 November 2004, the DA-IICT was included in the list of Universities maintained by the University Grants Commission under Section 2(f) of the UGC Act, 1956. DA-IICT is a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) as approved by the AIU at its 84th Annual Meeting held during 12-14 November 2009. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council, Government of India has accredited DA-IICT with an A+ Grade in 2023. The Legislative Assembly of Gujarat passed the DA-IICT Amendment Act Bill on 28th February 2024 and the DA-IICT Act (Amendment) 2024, which paved the way for the formation of the Dhirubhai Ambani University, and came into force by the announcement in the Gujarat Government Gazette dated 13th May 2024. Consequent upon the said amendments, the institute transforms itself into a multi-disciplinary university of new and emerging technologies and will establish institutions in other disciplines such as law, management etc. Vision and Mission The vision of the institute is to become a globally recognized institution that offers innovative programs, outstanding faculty, an atmosphere of innovation, a responsive administration, a vibrant campus and a collaborative learning environment that continuously adapts to the changing landscape of research and innovation and the future of work. Toward this, we plan to design and deliver academic programs in both disciplinary and multidisciplinary domains to prepare students for a rapidly evolving work environment. Govt. of Gujarat conferred the status of Centre of Excellence in January 2022 NAAC (Accreditation): A+ Grade (Year- 2023) Gujarat State Institutional Rating Framework (GSIRF) awarded Five-Star Rating in the last three years Selected as one of the Nodal Institutes to mentor Innovators by the Industries Commissionerate, Govt. of Gujarat Alumni who have excelled as entrepreneurs (founded and co-founded over 100 companies), technocrats (CTO, CEO), bureaucrats (IAS, IRS, IPS, IES), academicians (NUS, University of Chicago, University of Toronto, IIT Madras) Annual Student Scholarships: INR 4-5 Crores 2 DAU at a Glance Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research Oriented Academic Programs 3 Academics and Research at DAU Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology DA-IICT philosophy and vision DA-IICT since its inception has been an institute of interdisciplinarity and contemporary domains. B.Tech. programs in ICT and ICT honours with minor in computational science are testimonials to this. With its experience and expertise at institutional innovation and knowledge reform, DA-IICT is well-poised to provide knowledge and training to young minds to provide solutions to the challenges mentioned earlier. The ICT embodies the convergence of Computer and Communication systems and has obtained wide acceptance as a distinct discipline. It is also expected that ICT graduates would enjoy a special niche only if they have certain performance capabilities not found in conventional CSE and/or ECE graduates. Logically this convergence takes place at the systems level, but at the same time it is necessary to accept a certain level of granularity as one goes down to the level of circuits, devices and materials. All programs are designed to operate on a semester-based framework that follows choice-based credit system.

DA-IICT has played a pioneering role in developing innovative undergraduate programs in Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in India since 2001. A student trained in ICT is able to integrate Information Technology, Communication Technology, Electronics Engineering and Social Sciences courses with a solid grounding in Mathematics and Science, Humanities and Social Sciences, which a student trained in conventional Computer Science & Engineering or Electronics and Communication Engineering alone will not be able to do. B.Tech. (Honours) in ICT Program: This degree will be awarded to students who complete some extra course credits in addition to all credit/course/ internship/project requirements stipulated for the B.Tech. (ICT) program. These students have to complete a minimum of 15 additional credits (and a minimum of five additional courses) in the form of electives. 4 Program Overview Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology B.Tech. ICT curriculum consists of core courses, technical and open elective courses. Students will be working on Rural and Industrial internships during the program. They will be having  Foundational or Core Courses: These are set of compulsory courses taken by students during first 5 semesters. These courses are from the technical areas of Computer Science and Information Technology, Electronics and Communication, as well as courses in Humanities, Mathematics and Basic Sciences.  Elective Courses: These courses add to both, the technical strength and humanities and social science skills of the program. The students can choose the elective courses from the available ones from the fifth semester onwards. The elective courses are grouped into the following categories:  ICT Electives (ICTE)  Technical Electives (TE)  Humanities and Social Sciences Electives (HASSE)  Science Electives (SE)  Open Electives (OE)  Internships and BTech Projects: Students will be working during their 3rd semester winter break for the rural internships with NGOs or government organizations. During 6th semester summer, they will be working for their Research/Industrial Internship and during the 8th semester they have BTech Project (BTP) or Industrial Training Project (ITP).  Co-curricular activities: These are non-class activities like sports, cultural and technical club activities. These courses run over the first four semesters and are graded Pass/Fail.  Exploration Projects: The students explore their surroundings to identify interesting problems. They formulate a design based and/or hardware based solution and turn it into a product by leveraging the introduction to ICT skills learnt in the first semester. Students are expected to work in groups of 5 to 8 under a faculty mentor over two semesters - second and third semester.
