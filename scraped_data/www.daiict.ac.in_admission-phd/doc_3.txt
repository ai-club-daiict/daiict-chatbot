Guidelines and syllabus for the entrance exam (PhD in Mathematical, Physical, and Computational Sciences disciplines)  All candidates intending to pursue research in Mathematical, Physical, and Computational Sciences disciplines, except those granted waiver, have to appear for the examination.  The candidates have to take the exam in one of the following two subject papers: (a) Mathematics (MA), (b) Physics (PH).  The candidates will be administered the appropriate exam based on the preference chosen in the application form.  The exam will consist of 20 multiple choice questions to be answered in one hour. For every correct answer, the candidate will receive +4 marks, while for every incorrect answer the candidate will receive a negative 1 mark.  The marks obtained in the exam would be used for shortlisting the candidates for the interview.  During the interview, the questions will be based on the discipline that the candidate appeared for in the entrance exam. Candidates may also be asked questions on their undergraduate/postgraduate projects.  Syllabus: Mathematics: The question paper will be based on the following five areas of BSc/MSc level Mathematics curriculum. o Real Analysis o Complex Analysis o Abstract Algebra o Linear Algebra o Probability Theory Physics: The question paper will contain a set of 5 questions on Mathematics and the remaining 15 questions from four areas of undergraduate Physics curriculum listed below. o Mathematics: Discrete Structures, Calculus, Basic Linear Algebra, Basic Probability Theory o Classical Mechanics o Electrodynamics o Quantum Mechanics o Thermodynamics
