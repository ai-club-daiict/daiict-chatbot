DAU Research & Innovation Service to Society Academics Admissions 2025 Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology M.Tech. (ICT) with specialization in VLSI & Embedded Systems Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 2 DA-IICT was founded in 2000 as a unique university devoted to the cutting-edge interdisciplinary area of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). ICT was emerging as the technology of the future bringing in the fourth Industrial Revolution. Well known and highly qualified faculty members joined DA-IICT and developed a curriculum and research program steeped in all aspects of ICT, societal, scientific, and technical. This spirit has been nurtured for the last 23 years and DA-IICT wants to continue its excellence in interdisciplinary teaching and research well into the future. The Act No. 6 of 2003 of the Gujarat Legislature provided for the establishment of the DA-IICT and conferred on it the status of a University. On 30 November 2004, the DA-IICT was included in the list of Universities maintained by the University Grants Commission under Section 2(f) of the UGC Act, 1956. DA-IICT is a member of the Association of Indian Universities (AIU) as approved by the AIU at its 84th Annual Meeting held during 12-14 November 2009. The National Assessment and Accreditation Council, Government of India has accredited DA-IICT with an A+ Grade in 2023. The Legislative Assembly of Gujarat passed the DA-IICT Amendment Act Bill on 28th February 2024 and the DA-IICT Act (Amendment) 2024, which paved the way for the formation of the Dhirubhai Ambani University, and came into force by the announcement in the Gujarat Government Gazette dated 13th May 2024. Consequent upon the said amendments, the institute transforms itself into a multi-disciplinary university of new and emerging technologies and will establish institutions in other disciplines such as law, management etc. Vision and Mission The vision of the institute is to become a globally recognized institution that offers innovative programs, outstanding faculty, an atmosphere of innovation, a responsive administration, a vibrant campus and a collaborative learning environment that continuously adapts to the changing landscape of research and innovation and the future of work. Toward this, we plan to design and deliver academic programs in both disciplinary and multidisciplinary domains to prepare students for a rapidly evolving work environment. Govt. of Gujarat conferred the status of Centre of Excellence in January 2022 NAAC (Accreditation): A+ Grade (Year- 2023) Gujarat State Institutional Rating Framework (GSIRF) awarded Five-Star Rating in the last three years Selected as one of the Nodal Institutes to mentor Innovators by the Industries Commissionerate, Govt. of Gujarat Alumni who have excelled as entrepreneurs (founded and co-founded over 100 companies), technocrats (CTO, CEO), bureaucrats (IAS, IRS, IPS, IES), academicians (NUS, University of Chicago, University of Toronto, IIT Madras) Annual Student Scholarships: INR 4-5 Crores 2 DAU at a Glance Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology 3 Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary Research Oriented Academic Programs Academics and Research at DAU Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology Very-large-scale integration (VLSI) is the process of integrating or embedding millions of transistors on a single silicon semiconductor chip. VLSI technology is promising due to its high packing density, high speed and low power consumption. Embedded Systems is a domain where VLSI technology is used to build an application specific system and meet user requirements. VLSI and Embedded systems have opened up avenues in various fields such as aerospace, agriculture, automobile, consumer electronics, biomedical and many others. As per the statistics provided by Dr. Handel Jones, International Business Strategies (IBS) global VLSI/Semiconductor market revenue will approximately hit $600B by 2025. This revenue will be mainly derived from Internet of Things (IoT) semiconductor hardware and sensor market, semiconductor foundry, DRAM, Flash memory and Embedded Systems. Thus, VLSI and embedded systems play a major role in offering the best job opportunities. In order to support research and development for the VLSI and Embedded System industry, it is desirable to have a knowledge of semiconductor physics, IC fabrication technology, analog and digital design, low power VLSI circuits, Embedded Systems etc. Thus, in summary VLSI and Embedded Systems (VES) is one of the important components of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) discipline. The VES research group of ICT department in DA- IICT encompasses wide spectrum ranging from Microelectronics, Digital and Analog Integrated Circuits, VLSI Electronic Design Automation to Nanotechnology, MEMS and Embedded systems. The department has excellent research laboratories with availability of various state-of-the-art CAD tools, low power system testing, PCB fabrication facility to carry out research. The core research areas and on- going projects are in the areas of  Processor design and implementation, Low Power VLSI design, AI/ML in edge computing and HPC  Hardware security primitives, Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for Industrial IoT, Machine learning based solutions for Hardware Trojan detection and prevention, Design and modelling of MEMS sensors  Digital VLSI Architecture Design for High Performance Computer Arithmetic and Signal Processing Algorithms  Ultra Low Power and Sub-threshold  Circuit Methodologies, Very Low Voltage Circuits for Wireless Sensor Networks, Power Management for Energy Harvesters, Signal Processing Hardware for Color Image Processing  Chip design for application-oriented domains and embedded systems in areas, namely, military, automotive and agriculture  Digital VLSI design, Nanotechnology, Flexible electronics, Numerical Methods, Circuit and system design for bio-medical applications, System design for agriculture modernization, Graphene Interconnects and devices  MEMS, Sensor & System Design, IoT, Sensors Signal Conditioning, Self-healing Systems  Intelligent system and VLSI circuit engineering, Robotics The research carried out by the VES group has culminated into various publications in journals, conferences and book chapters of international repute, bringing several funded projects and incubation of many start-ups. The department has experienced faculty and dedicated labs for supporting Ph.D. and M.Tech. curriculum in VLSI and Embedded Systems. The program provides wide range of core VES subjects together with many electives from domains such as Machine Learning, Signal Processing and IoT to make the program more comprehensive and dynamic. 4 Program Overview Formerly known as Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology The important takeaways of the M.Tech. program in Machine Learning are as follows: Choice based curriculum: Flexibility to register for courses of your choice along with other compulsory courses:  To strengthen the foundation of ML through courses listed under Specialization Core and Specialization Electives  To broaden knowledge through courses listed under General Electives Hands-on Exposure through Minor Project-I: Equips students to be ready for contesting job positions in industry.
